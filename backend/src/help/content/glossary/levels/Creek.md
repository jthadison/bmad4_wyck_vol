# Creek

Creek is the primary support level within a [[Trading Range]], representing the point where professional accumulation is actively defending price during the consolidation phase. The Creek level serves as the key reference point for both pattern recognition and risk management, as it defines the boundary between normal range behavior and critical tests like the [[Spring]] pattern. Understanding Creek placement and its role in the Wyckoff methodology is essential for proper trade execution and risk control.

The Creek level is identified as the most significant support zone within the trading range established during [[Phase A]] and maintained through [[Phase B]]. This is typically the low of the [[Selling Climax]] (SC) or a comparable support level that has been repeatedly tested and defended. When price approaches Creek, traders observe volume and price action carefully: support at Creek on reduced volume indicates successful accumulation, while violation of Creek initiates the critical test that may result in a spring or signal failed accumulation.

Penetration of the Creek level is required for a valid [[Spring]] pattern. The spring represents a deliberate violation of Creek support designed to trigger stops and shake out weak holders before the markup begins in [[Phase D]]. However, the depth and character of the Creek violation distinguish a spring from a failed breakdown. A valid spring penetrates Creek but recovers quickly on diminished selling pressure, while a breakdown continues to make lower lows with sustained volume. The Creek violation must demonstrate "stopping action"—heavy selling that fails to drive prices significantly lower—to be considered a valid spring.

From a risk management perspective, Creek serves as the reference point for stop placement in accumulation trades. The standard approach places protective stops approximately 2 ATR (Average True Range) below the Creek level, providing enough room for a spring to develop while limiting capital exposure. If price violates Creek by more than this amount and reaches the [[Ice]] level (representing approximately twice the Creek penetration distance), the accumulation hypothesis is invalidated and positions should be exited. Creek is not merely a technical level—it represents the line in the sand where professional money has chosen to defend their accumulation, making it the foundation of Wyckoff risk management.
