# SOS (Sign of Strength)

A Sign of Strength (SOS) is a high-volume breakout above resistance that signals the completion of professional accumulation and the beginning of the markup phase. The SOS is the defining event of [[Phase D]] accumulation, representing the transition from range-bound consolidation to directional trending. This pattern demonstrates that professional money is ready to aggressively push prices higher, overwhelming any remaining supply and establishing the new uptrend.

The SOS is characterized by decisive price action and confirming volume behavior. Price should penetrate above the resistance level established during the [[Trading Range]] with clear conviction, typically on a strong bar that closes near its high. Volume must expand significantly compared to the recent range-bound activity, indicating aggressive buying by professional operators. This combination of price progress and volume confirmation demonstrates that demand has overwhelmed supply and that the balance of power has shifted from sellers to buyers. An SOS on light volume or with weak price action suggests a false breakout rather than genuine professional sponsorship.

While the SOS represents an important transition point, it is not typically the optimal entry location for traders. The aggressive nature of the breakout often leads to short-term overextension, and traders who chase the SOS frequently experience immediate heat on their positions. More importantly, the SOS is often followed by a [[Last Point of Support]] (LPS)—a pullback to retest the breakout level that provides a superior entry opportunity with better defined risk and improved risk-reward ratios.

Professional traders view the SOS as confirmation that their accumulation analysis was correct rather than as an entry signal. The SOS validates that the cause built during Phase B has been sufficient to drive a trending move, and it establishes the resistance-turned-support level that will be tested at subsequent LPS points. Understanding the relationship between SOS and LPS is crucial: the SOS proves the professional case, while the LPS provides the practical entry. Traders who wait patiently for the LPS rather than chasing the SOS demonstrate the discipline required for successful Wyckoff trading.
