# UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution)

An Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) is a price move above resistance in a distribution range that fails quickly, representing the mirror image of the spring pattern in accumulation. The UTAD occurs during [[Phase C]] of distribution and serves as the final test that validates the professional distribution hypothesis. This pattern creates a bull trap, attracting late buyers and allowing professionals to complete their distribution at elevated prices before the markdown begins.

The UTAD pattern demonstrates classic Wyckoff principles of effort versus result. The upward thrust appears bullish on the surface, often breaking above prior highs with what seems like strong momentum. However, the critical element is that this apparent strength fails to attract sustained buying interest. Volume analysis reveals the truth: the breakout occurs on climactic volume as professionals aggressively distribute into public demand, but the rally cannot be sustained. Price quickly reverses back below the resistance level, trapping buyers who chased the breakout and confirming that demand has been exhausted.

The ideal UTAD exhibits several characteristics. First, it should penetrate above the upper boundary of the [[Trading Range]] with conviction, creating the appearance of a legitimate breakout. Second, volume should spike during the thrust, reflecting heavy distribution by professionals into public buying. Third, the reversal should occur rapidly—typically within a few bars—demonstrating that once the supply from professionals is complete, no genuine demand exists to support higher prices. Finally, price should fall back into the range and begin to show weakness, setting the stage for the markdown that follows in [[Phase D]].

Distinguishing a UTAD from a genuine breakout requires patience and discipline. Traders should avoid chasing breakouts to new highs during distribution ranges, as the UTAD specifically targets this behavior. Instead, wait for the reversal to confirm, then look for opportunities to enter short positions as price demonstrates an inability to reclaim the resistance level. The UTAD creates an optimal short setup: resistance becomes overhead supply, stops can be placed just above the UTAD high, and the profit potential extends to the full downside projection from the distribution range. Understanding the UTAD is crucial for avoiding bull traps and correctly identifying when accumulation has transitioned to distribution.
