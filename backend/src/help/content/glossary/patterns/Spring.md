# Spring

A spring is a price move below the [[Creek]] support level that reverses quickly with reduced volume, representing the final shakeout before an accumulation range transitions to markup. The spring is the hallmark pattern of [[Phase C]] accumulation and serves as a critical test that validates the professional accumulation hypothesis. When executed properly, a spring traps retail traders in poor positions while allowing smart money to complete their accumulation at favorable prices.

The anatomy of a valid spring requires several key elements. First, price must penetrate below the established [[Creek]] support level—the primary support boundary of the [[Trading Range]]—with enough conviction to trigger protective stops placed by retail traders. Second, the volume characteristics during the spring are critical: initial selling should be heavy as stops are hit, but price should fail to continue lower, indicating absorption by professional buyers. Third, the reversal back into the range must occur quickly, typically within one to three bars, demonstrating that selling pressure has been exhausted. A spring that lingers below Creek or continues to make lower lows suggests failed accumulation rather than a valid test.

The distinction between a valid spring and a failed breakdown hinges on the depth of penetration and subsequent recovery. A spring should violate Creek but remain well above the [[Ice]] level, which represents a deeper support zone approximately twice the Creek penetration distance. If price breaks below Ice, the accumulation hypothesis is invalidated, and traders should exit positions rather than expecting a spring. Conversely, a spring that barely penetrates Creek or immediately reverses with diminishing volume provides the strongest confirmation.

Traders should not attempt to buy the initial breakdown below Creek, as distinguishing a spring from a genuine breakdown in real-time is extremely difficult. Instead, wait for price to reclaim the Creek level and demonstrate the ability to hold above it before entering positions. The spring creates an optimal risk-reward scenario: stops can be placed just below the spring low, while the profit potential extends to the full [[Jump]] target projected from the range. Understanding springs is essential for successful Wyckoff trading, as they represent the final opportunity to enter accumulation before the markup phase begins in [[Phase D]].
