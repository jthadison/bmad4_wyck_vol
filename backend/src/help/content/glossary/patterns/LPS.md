# LPS (Last Point of Support)

The Last Point of Support (LPS) is a throwback to support after a [[SOS]] (Sign of Strength) that provides the optimal entry opportunity in [[Phase D]] of accumulation. While the SOS confirms that professional accumulation is complete and the markup has begun, the LPS offers traders a second chance to enter with superior risk-reward characteristics. The LPS represents a retest of the breakout level, now acting as support, and demonstrates that the new trend has sufficient backing to continue.

The ideal LPS occurs when price pulls back to test the resistance level that was broken during the SOS, which now serves as support due to the principle of polarity. Volume should diminish significantly during the pullback, indicating that selling pressure is minimal and that professionals are not distributing their accumulated positions. Price should find support at or near the prior resistance level, often forming a consolidation pattern or shallow retracement before resuming the uptrend. The depth of the pullback can vary—some LPS events barely retrace at all, while others return fully to the breakout level—but the critical element is that support holds and the uptrend resumes.

The LPS provides substantial advantages over entering at the SOS. First, the risk is clearly defined: stops can be placed just below the LPS support level, which is typically the same as or close to the original breakout point. Second, the entry price is better, as traders buy on weakness rather than strength. Third, the risk-reward ratio is superior, as the entry is closer to support while the profit target (the [[Jump]] projection) remains constant. Finally, the LPS tests trader discipline—waiting for the pullback requires patience and conviction, but it demonstrates the professional approach of buying support rather than chasing breakouts.

Multiple LPS events may occur during Phase D as the trend establishes itself. Each successful test of support on reduced volume provides additional confirmation that the accumulation was valid and the markup will continue. Traders should not assume that the first pullback after an SOS will be the "last" point of support in a literal sense; rather, view each LPS as an opportunity to add to positions or enter if the initial opportunity was missed. The LPS is the cornerstone pattern for entering Wyckoff accumulation trades, representing the practical application of buying support in the early stages of a new uptrend.
