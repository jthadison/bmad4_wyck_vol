# No Demand

No Demand is a specific Volume Spread Analysis (VSA) pattern characterized by a narrow price spread combined with relatively high volume appearing at or near resistance levels, indicating that professional buyers are absent and institutional demand has evaporated. This pattern serves as a critical warning signal in distribution structures and validates the hypothesis that smart money is exiting positions.

## Pattern Characteristics

A valid No Demand pattern exhibits the following characteristics:

1. **Narrow Price Spread**: The bar's range from high to low is compressed compared to recent bars
2. **High or Elevated Volume**: Volume exceeds normal levels, often reaching [[High Volume]] thresholds
3. **Position at Resistance**: Occurs at or near established resistance levels or after a rally attempt
4. **Close Near Low**: Ideally closes in the lower portion of the narrow spread
5. **Context**: Appears during distribution phases or after extended markup

The paradox of No Demand is that volume is elevated yet price cannot advance—this demonstrates that professional buyers are stepping aside while supply overwhelms the diminished demand.

## Volume-Price Divergence

No Demand represents a critical divergence between volume and price action. Under normal conditions, high volume should drive price movement—either advancing powerfully on buying pressure or declining sharply on selling pressure. When high volume produces only a narrow spread with limited upward progress, it reveals that professionals are not supporting the rally.

The elevated volume comes from retail buyers chasing price higher and professionals quietly distributing into this demand. The professionals sell enough to prevent price from advancing, creating the narrow spread despite the increased activity. This selling absorption by demand creates the distribution that professionals seek.

## Distribution Signal

No Demand patterns appear prominently during distribution structures, particularly in:

- **[[Phase D]] Distribution**: As price attempts to rally after establishing a [[Trading Range]]
- **[[Last Point of Supply]] (LPSY)**: Final rally attempts before markdown accelerates
- **Resistance Tests**: When price challenges the top of distribution range
- **After [[Up Thrust]]**: Following temporary penetrations above resistance

Each occurrence of No Demand reinforces the distribution hypothesis, warning traders that professional support has evaporated and markdown is approaching. The pattern indicates that smart money is no longer accumulating but actively distributing holdings to retail participants.

## Distinguishing from No Supply

[[No Supply]] is the accumulation counterpart to No Demand, appearing at support levels with narrow spreads and [[Low Volume]]. The key differences:

| Characteristic | No Demand (Distribution) | No Supply (Accumulation) |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Volume | High or elevated | Low or diminishing |
| Location | Resistance / Top of range | Support / Bottom of range |
| Spread | Narrow (unable to advance) | Narrow (no selling pressure) |
| Implication | Weakness / Distribution | Strength / Accumulation |
| Phase | Phase D Distribution | Phase C Accumulation |

These opposite patterns reveal fundamental supply/demand dynamics—No Demand shows supply overwhelming weak demand, while No Supply shows demand present with supply exhausted.

## Trading Implications

When No Demand patterns appear:

1. **Avoid Buying**: Resistance to advancing price despite volume indicates weakness
2. **Consider Exits**: Existing long positions face increased risk as distribution progresses
3. **Short Preparation**: Accumulation of No Demand patterns may justify short positions in [[Phase E]]
4. **Reduce Exposure**: Portfolio heat should be reduced in anticipation of markdown

No Demand does not provide precise entry signals for short positions—it warns of changing conditions and suggests defensive positioning. Traders should wait for clear distribution confirmation ([[Sign of Weakness]], [[Up Thrust]], failed rallies) before aggressively positioning for markdown.

## Pattern Validation

Not every narrow-spread bar with elevated volume constitutes No Demand. Validation requires:

- **Context within distribution structure**: Must appear in appropriate phase
- **Resistance proximity**: Should occur near established resistance
- **Follow-through**: Subsequent bars should fail to advance or should decline
- **Absence of bullish spring**: No authentic accumulation patterns should appear

False No Demand signals can occur during consolidation or accumulation phases, which is why context and market phase identification are essential. Traders must evaluate the broader Wyckoff structure before interpreting individual VSA patterns.
