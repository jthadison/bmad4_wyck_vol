# No Supply

No Supply is a specific Volume Spread Analysis (VSA) pattern characterized by a narrow price spread combined with [[Low Volume]] appearing at or near support levels, indicating that professional sellers are absent and supply has been exhausted. This pattern serves as a critical confirmation signal in accumulation structures and validates the hypothesis that smart money has completed position building.

## Pattern Characteristics

A valid No Supply pattern exhibits the following characteristics:

1. **Narrow Price Spread**: The bar's range from high to low is compressed compared to recent bars
2. **Low Volume**: Volume falls below 0.5× average, significantly reduced from earlier selling episodes
3. **Position at Support**: Occurs at or near established support levels, particularly [[Creek]]
4. **Close Near High**: Ideally closes in the upper portion of the narrow spread
5. **Context**: Appears during [[Phase C]] accumulation after [[Phase B]] range development

The low volume demonstrates that sellers who were previously willing to transact at these price levels have withdrawn—supply has been absorbed during earlier accumulation phases.

## Supply Exhaustion Signal

No Supply indicates that the professional selling pressure observed during [[Phase A]] and [[Phase B]] has been absorbed. During the [[Selling Climax]] (SC) and subsequent tests, professionals accumulated shares from panicked retail sellers. By the time Phase C testing occurs, those sellers have exited positions and are no longer present.

When price returns to or tests below support on No Supply characteristics, it confirms that:

- Weak holders have been shaken out during earlier phases
- Professional sellers are not present (they completed distribution higher)
- Remaining supply is minimal and easily absorbed
- Markup conditions are favorable as resistance to upward movement has been removed

This supply exhaustion is the prerequisite for markup—price cannot advance sustainably while supply remains. No Supply confirms this condition has been met.

## Phase C Test Validation

No Supply patterns most commonly appear during [[Phase C]] accumulation testing moves. The ideal Phase C test exhibits:

1. Price returns to Creek support (possibly slight penetration in a [[Spring]])
2. Volume contracts dramatically compared to SC and earlier tests
3. Narrow spread indicates lack of selling pressure
4. Quick recovery demonstrates residual demand with no supply resistance

This combination validates the accumulation structure and significantly increases the confidence score for subsequent [[Sign of Strength]] (SOS) and [[Last Point of Support]] (LPS) patterns. The No Supply test confirms that professionals have completed accumulation and the market is ready for markup.

## Distinguishing from No Demand

[[No Demand]] is the distribution counterpart to No Supply, appearing at resistance levels. The key differences:

| Characteristic | No Supply (Accumulation) | No Demand (Distribution) |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Volume | Low or diminishing | High or elevated |
| Location | Support / Bottom of range | Resistance / Top of range |
| Spread | Narrow (no selling) | Narrow (unable to advance) |
| Implication | Strength / Accumulation | Weakness / Distribution |
| Phase | Phase C Accumulation | Phase D Distribution |

These opposite patterns reveal fundamental supply/demand dynamics through the lens of volume and price spread relationships.

## Trading Implications

When No Supply patterns appear during Phase C:

1. **Entry Preparation**: Accumulation nearing completion, prepare for SOS entry
2. **Confidence Increase**: Validates accumulation hypothesis, increases position sizing justification
3. **Risk Clarification**: Confirms Creek level as structural stop placement
4. **Campaign Initiation**: May trigger campaign setup if other conditions met

No Supply does not itself provide entry signals—it confirms conditions favorable for markup. Traders should wait for [[Sign of Strength]] or [[Last Point of Support]] patterns before entering positions, using No Supply as validation of the accumulation structure.

## Pattern Validation

Not every low-volume bar with a narrow spread constitutes No Supply. Validation requires:

- **Context within accumulation structure**: Must appear in Phase C after established Phase B range
- **Support proximity**: Should occur at or near Creek support
- **Previous volume context**: Must show reduction from earlier selling episodes
- **Follow-through**: Subsequent bars should hold above support and show resilience

False No Supply signals can occur during distribution consolidations or before final capitulation. Traders must confirm the broader Wyckoff structure and phase identification before interpreting individual VSA patterns. The presence of No Supply during Phase C, particularly after a [[Secondary Test]] or Spring, provides strong confirmation that accumulation is complete and markup is imminent.

## Application in Confidence Scoring

The Wyckoff application's confidence scoring algorithm gives significant weight to No Supply characteristics when evaluating Phase C tests. A Spring or test that exhibits:

- Low volume (<0.5× average)
- Narrow spread (<50% of recent average range)
- Quick recovery above Creek
- Absence of follow-through selling

will receive elevated confidence scores, often qualifying for the HIGH confidence tier (≥70). This algorithmic recognition mirrors the manual analysis that Wyckoff practitioners perform, codifying the importance of No Supply in validating accumulation structures.
