# ST - Secondary Test

The Secondary Test (ST) is a return to or near the [[Selling Climax]] (SC) low that occurs after the [[Automatic Rally]] (AR), serving to verify that selling pressure has been truly exhausted. The defining characteristic of a successful ST is significantly reduced volume compared to the SC, demonstrating that the sellers who created the climax are no longer present. The ST can occur in late [[Phase A]] or early [[Phase B]] and often sets the lower boundary of the trading range.

## Characteristics of Secondary Test

A valid ST exhibits the following characteristics:

1. **Price Level**: Returns to or near SC low (within 5%-10% typically)
2. **Reduced Volume**: Significantly lower than SC volume, ideally showing [[No Supply]]
3. **Narrow Spread**: Compressed range compared to SC, indicating lack of selling pressure
4. **Quick Recovery**: Price rebounds relatively quickly, showing resilient demand
5. **After AR**: Occurs following the automatic rally, not immediately after SC

The volume reduction is the critical validation—the ST proves that the SC exhausted sellers by showing they are absent when price returns to that level.

## Purpose of the Secondary Test

The ST serves multiple functions in the accumulation process:

1. **Supply Verification**: Confirms that selling pressure was truly exhausted at SC
2. **Professional Accumulation**: Allows additional accumulation near the low
3. **Range Establishment**: Helps define the lower boundary of [[Phase B]] trading range
4. **Trader Education**: Shakes out weak hands who bought the AR expecting immediate recovery
5. **Stop Absorption**: Triggers stops of premature buyers, providing more accumulation liquidity

The test is "secondary" because it is the second major test of the low—the SC being the primary test. This second test with reduced volume validates that the first test was indeed climactic.

## Volume Analysis is Critical

The volume characteristics at the ST differentiate a successful test from a failed test:

**Successful ST (Accumulation Validated)**:
- Volume 40%-60% of SC volume or lower
- Shows [[No Supply]] or [[Low Volume]]
- Narrow spread indicating no selling pressure
- Quick recovery demonstrating support

**Failed ST (Accumulation Questionable)**:
- Volume approaches or exceeds SC levels
- Wide spread showing continued selling
- Sluggish recovery or new lows
- Suggests more capitulation needed

The volume comparison is typically done using:
```
ST Volume Ratio = ST Volume / SC Volume

Ideal: <0.5 (less than half of SC volume)
Acceptable: 0.5 - 0.7
Concerning: >0.7
```

Lower ratios indicate more thorough supply exhaustion and higher probability of successful accumulation.

## Multiple Secondary Tests

Accumulation structures often exhibit multiple STs as professionals build positions:

**First ST**:
- Immediately after AR
- Tests if SC selling truly exhausted
- Establishes initial range low

**Subsequent STs**:
- Later tests during Phase B
- Ideally show progressively lower volume
- Each test confirms supply absorption
- May undercut or hold above prior lows

The pattern of decreasing volume on successive tests is highly bullish, showing that each test removes more remaining supply. If volume increases on later tests, it warns that supply is reappearing and the accumulation may be failing.

## ST vs. Spring Distinction

Both ST and [[Spring]] are tests of support, but they occur in different phases and have different characteristics:

| Characteristic | ST | Spring |
|---------------|----|----|---|
| Phase | Late Phase A / Early Phase B | Phase C |
| Reference Point | SC low | [[Creek]] support |
| Purpose | Verify SC exhaustion | Final shake out before markup |
| Penetration | May or may not undercut SC | Deliberately penetrates Creek |
| Context | Early accumulation | Late accumulation |

The ST occurs early in the accumulation to validate the initial bottom, while the Spring occurs later as the final test before markup begins in [[Phase D]].

## Phase Transition Role

The ST often marks the transition from [[Phase A]] to [[Phase B]]:

**Phase A Conclusion**:
- SC establishes approximate low
- AR demonstrates selling exhaustion
- ST confirms exhaustion with reduced volume

**Phase B Beginning**:
- ST sets lower range boundary
- Price begins trading between ST low and AR high
- Professional accumulation continues within range
- Volume analysis guides accumulation assessment

This transition is not always clearly delineated—some practitioners consider the ST as the final Phase A event, while others view it as the first Phase B event. The classification matters less than understanding the function: the ST validates the bottom and establishes range structure.

## Trading Implications

The ST does not typically provide immediate entry signals. During the ST:

1. **Observe Volume**: Assess whether selling pressure has truly disappeared
2. **Note Range Boundaries**: ST low and AR high define initial trading range
3. **Wait for Structure**: Allow [[Phase B]] to develop before considering entries
4. **Prepare for Phase C**: Anticipate eventual testing phase that will provide entry signals
5. **Avoid Premature Entry**: Accumulation is still early; better opportunities will develop

Traders who bought the AR and are stopped out at the ST are being educated by professionals—the market teaches patience by requiring traders to wait for structured entry setups rather than chasing early rallies.

## Failed Secondary Test

A failed ST occurs when:

- Price makes new lows below SC
- Volume increases rather than decreases
- Wide spread and continued selling pressure appear
- Recovery is weak or nonexistent

Failed STs invalidate the accumulation hypothesis and suggest that:
- The SC was not truly climactic
- More decline is needed to exhaust sellers
- Accumulation may occur at lower levels
- Traders should wait for actual capitulation

When an ST fails, the prudent response is to step aside and wait for a genuine SC-AR-ST sequence to develop at lower levels.

## Application in Campaign Analysis

When reviewing potential campaign opportunities, traders should analyze the ST characteristics:

**Strong Campaign Setup**:
- Clear SC with climactic volume
- Meaningful AR (≥50% retracement)
- ST shows <50% of SC volume
- Range boundaries clearly defined
- Multiple tests show decreasing volume

**Weak Campaign Setup**:
- Unclear or questionable SC
- Shallow AR (<40% retracement)
- ST volume approaches SC levels
- Range boundaries ambiguous
- Tests show inconsistent volume patterns

The quality of the ST significantly impacts the overall campaign confidence score and probability of successful markup after accumulation completes.

## Professional Behavior at ST

Understanding professional operator behavior at the ST provides insight:

1. **Continued Accumulation**: Professionals buy additional shares near the tested low
2. **Position Sizing**: May increase commitment if ST shows excellent characteristics
3. **Patient Holding**: No selling despite the test—professionals bought at SC for value, not quick profits
4. **Structural Awareness**: Professionals understand range development and aren't shaken by normal testing

Retail traders often panic when price returns to the low during the ST, while professionals recognize this as normal market behavior and an accumulation opportunity.
