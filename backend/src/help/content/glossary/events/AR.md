# AR - Automatic Rally

The Automatic Rally (AR) is the sharp rebound that occurs immediately following a [[Selling Climax]] (SC), representing the natural market response when selling pressure is completely exhausted and professionals cease absorbing supply. This rally is "automatic" because it requires no additional buying pressure—it occurs simply due to the absence of sellers after the climactic selling event.

## Characteristics of Automatic Rally

A valid AR exhibits several key characteristics:

1. **Immediate Timing**: Occurs directly after the SC, typically within 1-3 bars
2. **Sharp Upward Movement**: Price advances briskly with expanding spread
3. **Reduced or Moderate Volume**: Volume is lower than SC, showing selling exhaustion
4. **Significant Recovery**: Retraces 40%-75% or more of the SC decline
5. **Professional Support**: Professionals hold their SC positions rather than reselling

The AR demonstrates that the SC successfully absorbed selling pressure—if sellers remained active, the rally could not occur.

## Mechanism of the Automatic Rally

The AR occurs through a natural supply-demand rebalancing:

1. **Supply Exhaustion**: The SC absorbs all panicked selling
2. **Professional Holding**: SC buyers hold positions, withdrawing supply from market
3. **Short Covering**: Short sellers begin covering, creating buying pressure
4. **Sentiment Shift**: Market participants recognize selling may be exhausted
5. **Vacuum Rally**: Absence of supply allows price to rise easily
6. **Natural Resistance**: Rally stalls at resistance or when profit-taking begins

This process requires no aggressive professional buying—the rally is automatic because supply has been removed from the market through the SC absorption.

## SC Confirmation Role

The AR serves as essential confirmation that the SC was genuine:

**Valid SC → Strong AR**
- Sharp rally following SC
- Volume lower than SC
- Significant retracement
- Validates accumulation hypothesis

**Invalid SC → Weak/No AR**
- Minimal rally or continuation lower
- Volume remains elevated
- Supply still present
- Suggests downtrend continues

Without a meaningful AR, the supposed SC was merely a temporary volume spike in an ongoing decline. The AR's presence and character validate the climactic nature of the selling event.

## AR High as Resistance

The AR high establishes an important structural level:

- Creates the initial resistance boundary for [[Phase B]] trading range
- Professional profit-taking may occur at AR high
- Tests of AR high during Phase B show supply absorption progress
- Breakout above AR high (with [[Sign of Strength]]) confirms accumulation completion

The AR high often marks the approximate top of the eventual trading range, though this boundary may be adjusted through Phase B development.

## Volume Characteristics

AR volume analysis provides insights into market structure:

**Ideal AR Volume**:
- Lower than SC volume (often 30%-60% of SC)
- Shows selling exhaustion
- Demonstrates professionals not reselling
- May gradually increase toward AR high

**High AR Volume**:
- May indicate professional distribution into rally
- Suggests supply still present
- Weakens accumulation hypothesis
- Requires careful monitoring of subsequent action

**Very Low AR Volume**:
- Excellent sign of supply removal
- Strong vacuum rally
- High probability of successful accumulation
- Professionals firmly holding SC positions

The volume pattern during the AR reveals whether professionals are committed to holding or distributing their SC purchases.

## Retracement Depth

The AR's retracement percentage provides information about accumulation strength:

| Retracement | Significance |
|-------------|-------------|
| 75%+ | Very strong, excellent supply removal |
| 50%-75% | Strong, typical healthy accumulation |
| 40%-50% | Moderate, acceptable but watch for supply |
| <40% | Weak, suggests supply remains or downtrend continues |

Deeper retracements indicate more thorough supply exhaustion and professional commitment. Shallow retracements may indicate the accumulation is questionable or that additional climactic selling will be required.

## Relationship to Secondary Test

Following the AR, price typically declines in a [[Secondary Test]] (ST) back toward the SC low:

**AR → ST Sequence:**
1. SC absorbs panic selling
2. AR rallies as selling exhausted
3. Professionals take profits at AR high
4. ST returns toward SC low on reduced volume
5. ST confirms supply exhaustion through low volume test

The AR and ST work together to establish the boundaries of the [[Phase B]] trading range and validate the accumulation hypothesis through the volume characteristics at each test.

## Failed Automatic Rally

Not every rally after a high-volume down bar constitutes a valid AR. A failed AR occurs when:

- Rally is minimal (<30% retracement)
- Volume remains elevated during rally (no exhaustion)
- Price quickly reverses to new lows
- Supply continues to press market

Failed ARs indicate the supposed SC was not climactic and the downtrend will likely continue. This failure invalidates the accumulation hypothesis and suggests traders should wait for actual capitulation.

## Trading Implications

The AR does not provide entry signals, as it occurs too early in the accumulation process. During the AR:

1. **Observe, Don't Trade**: Let the rally develop without interference
2. **Note AR High**: Mark this level as potential range resistance
3. **Assess Volume**: Evaluate whether selling appears exhausted
4. **Wait for Structure**: Allow [[Phase B]] range to establish before considering entries
5. **Prepare for ST**: Anticipate the subsequent test of SC low

Attempting to buy during the AR is premature—better entries develop after the trading range is established and tested in [[Phase C]].

## Multiple Rally Attempts

Some accumulation structures show multiple rally attempts from the SC low before establishing a sustained AR. This can occur when:

- Initial rallies meet persistent supply
- Professionals accumulate gradually rather than aggressively
- Market structure is complex
- Additional sellers must be exhausted

The final successful AR that establishes the range boundary is the one that shows the best volume characteristics (reduced vs. SC) and deepest retracement.

## Application in Phase Identification

Identifying the AR helps traders recognize they are potentially viewing a [[Phase A]] accumulation structure:

**Phase A Identification**:
1. Locate high-volume down bar (possible SC)
2. Identify sharp rally following (AR)
3. Watch for return toward low (ST approaching)
4. Monitor volume reduction on tests
5. Assess whether range is developing

This identification allows traders to track the accumulation as it develops through Phase B and toward eventual Phase C entry opportunities. The AR is a critical landmark in this phase identification process.
