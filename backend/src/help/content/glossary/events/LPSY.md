# LPSY - Last Point of Supply

Last Point of Supply (LPSY) represents the final rally attempt in a distribution structure before markdown accelerates into [[Phase E]]. This rally occurs after one or more [[Sign of Weakness]] (SOW) events and provides the last opportunity for remaining bulls to exit positions and for bears to establish short positions before significant downside movement. The LPSY is characterized by diminishing volume and inability to make new highs, demonstrating that demand has been exhausted.

## Characteristics of LPSY

A valid LPSY exhibits several key characteristics:

1. **Rally After SOW**: Occurs following [[Sign of Weakness]] decline(s)
2. **Diminishing Volume**: Volume reduced compared to prior rallies, showing [[No Demand]]
3. **Lower High**: Typically fails to exceed the prior high in the trading range
4. **Narrow Spread**: Compressed upward range indicating lack of demand
5. **Weak Close**: Often closes in the lower portion of the rally bar
6. **Phase D/E Context**: Appears late in distribution structure or early markdown
7. **Subsequent Decline**: Followed by accelerated markdown

The LPSY represents the final liquidity opportunity for professionals to complete distribution before they stop supporting price entirely.

## Mechanism of Last Point of Supply

The LPSY occurs through the following process:

1. **SOW Decline**: Price declines sharply, breaking range support
2. **Retail Hope**: Remaining bulls hope the decline was temporary
3. **Rally Attempt**: Price rebounds toward range resistance
4. **Diminished Demand**: But buying pressure is weak ([[No Demand]])
5. **Professional Distribution**: Professionals sell into the rally, completing distribution
6. **Rally Failure**: Rally stalls and reverses, unable to reclaim highs
7. **Markdown Acceleration**: With professionals no longer supporting, price declines sharply

This mechanism allows professionals to distribute final positions at better prices than the SOW low, while retail traders interpret the rally as a "recovery" and buy what professionals are selling.

## Distribution Structure Position

The LPSY appears in a specific context:

**Distribution Timeline**:
1. **Phase A-C**: Range development and distribution
2. **Phase D**: [[Sign of Weakness]] appears, breaking support
3. **Rally**: Price recovers toward range (LPSY forming)
4. **LPSY**: Rally fails on low volume
5. **Phase E**: Accelerated markdown / downtrend

The LPSY is the final event before markdown becomes relentless. After LPSY, there may be minor rallies, but none should threaten the distribution structure or reclaim the range highs.

## Volume Analysis is Critical

The volume characteristics at LPSY are essential for identification:

**Valid LPSY Volume**:
- Significantly reduced from earlier rallies
- Shows [[No Demand]] (narrow spread, high volume unable to advance)
- May be very low if retail participation has dried up
- Contrasts with high volume at prior rallies during Phase B-C

**Volume Comparison Framework**:
```
LPSY Volume / Average Rally Volume in Range

Ideal: <0.6 (less than 60% of average rally volume)
Acceptable: 0.6 - 0.8
Questionable: >0.8
```

Lower volume indicates demand exhaustion—fewer buyers remain willing to purchase at these levels.

## Multiple LPSY Events

Distribution structures may show multiple LPSY candidates as markdown develops:

**First LPSY**:
- First rally after initial SOW
- Tests whether demand remains
- May fail to reach range resistance

**Subsequent LPSY Events**:
- Each rally weaker than prior
- Lower highs developing
- Volume progressively diminishing
- Downtrend confirmed

Each failed rally reinforces the distribution case and provides potential short entry opportunities, though the most reliable short entry is typically the first clear LPSY after a confirmed SOW.

## LPSY vs. LPS Distinction

LPSY (distribution) and [[Last Point of Support]] (LPS) are opposite events in opposite structures:

| Characteristic | LPSY (Distribution) | LPS (Accumulation) |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Direction | Rally (upward) | Pullback (downward) |
| Phase | Phase D Distribution | Phase D Accumulation |
| Volume | Diminishing ([[No Demand]]) | Can be varied |
| Trading Action | Short entry | Long entry |
| Follow-Through | Markdown | Markup |
| Professional Behavior | Final distribution | Supporting positions |

The symmetry is important: LPS provides bullish entry after accumulation, while LPSY provides bearish entry after distribution.

## Trading Implications - Short Entry

The LPSY represents one of the highest-probability short entry opportunities in Wyckoff analysis:

**Entry Criteria**:
1. Confirmed distribution structure (Phase B-C identified)
2. Clear SOW has occurred (broken range support)
3. Rally shows LPSY characteristics (low volume, lower high, weak close)
4. Entry: Short near LPSY high or on breakdown from LPSY rally
5. Stop: Above LPSY high or above range high
6. Target: Initial target at SOW low, extended target into markdown

**Risk/Reward Advantages**:
- Entry near rally high minimizes initial risk
- Stop placement above LPSY is logical and contained
- Downside potential into markdown is substantial
- Probability is high after confirmed distribution

The LPSY provides structured short entry with defined risk, unlike attempting to short during the initial SOW where the rally back (the LPSY itself) would hit stops.

## Long Position Exit Signal

For traders holding long positions, the LPSY provides a critical exit signal:

**Exit Decision Framework**:
1. **After SOW**: Should have raised exit consideration
2. **On LPSY Rally**: Final opportunity to exit near better prices
3. **Volume Confirmation**: If rally shows [[No Demand]], exit immediately
4. **No New Highs**: If rally fails to exceed range highs, exit
5. **LPSY Failure**: If price reverses from LPSY, exit all remaining longs

Traders who fail to exit at LPSY will face accelerating losses as markdown develops in Phase E. The LPSY is the "last chance" exit opportunity before conditions deteriorate significantly.

## Distinguishing from Accumulation Tests

Rally failures can occur in both accumulation and distribution, requiring careful differentiation:

**LPSY (Distribution)**:
- Follows SOW (break of range support with high volume)
- Prior structure shows distribution signs ([[Up Thrust]], [[No Demand]])
- Rally volume diminishing
- Context is distribution Phase D/E

**Test Rally (Accumulation)**:
- Follows [[Spring]] or test with [[No Supply]]
- Prior structure shows accumulation signs
- Rally may show strength ([[Sign of Strength]])
- Context is accumulation Phase C/D

Context is paramount—the same price action (rally failure) has opposite implications depending on whether the structure is accumulation or distribution.

## Failed LPSY

A failed LPSY occurs when:

- Rally exceeds range highs (not a lower high)
- Volume increases rather than decreases (demand present)
- Price sustains above range (breakout)
- Structure was accumulation, not distribution

Failed LPSY events invalidate the distribution hypothesis and suggest traders misidentified the market structure. When an apparent LPSY fails by breaking out higher, reassess whether the structure is actually accumulation nearing markup.

## Confidence Scoring Application

When evaluating potential LPSY candidates for short entries:

**High Confidence LPSY**:
- Clear SOW preceded it (high volume breakdown)
- Multiple distribution signals in Phase B-C (UT, No Demand)
- Rally shows very low volume (<50% of average rally)
- Lower high by meaningful margin (>3% below range high)
- Narrow spread on LPSY bar

**Medium Confidence LPSY**:
- SOW present but not dramatic
- Some distribution signs but not conclusive
- Rally volume somewhat reduced
- Marginal lower high

**Low Confidence LPSY**:
- Unclear SOW
- Ambiguous prior structure
- Rally volume not significantly reduced
- High approaches or exceeds range top

Higher confidence LPSYs justify larger position sizing and tighter stops, while lower confidence setups require more conservative positioning.

## Professional vs. Retail Behavior

The LPSY exemplifies behavioral differences:

**Retail Traders**:
- Interpret LPSY rally as "recovery" from SOW decline
- Buy the rally, expecting return to range highs
- Ignore volume reduction signals
- Become trapped as markdown resumes

**Professional Operators**:
- Recognize LPSY as final distribution opportunity
- Sell remaining positions into the rally
- After LPSY completion, may establish short positions
- Understand markdown will accelerate

This behavioral divergence creates the volume and liquidity patterns that define the LPSY—retail buying colliding with professional distribution, with professionals selling enough to prevent sustained rally despite retail enthusiasm.
