# PS - Preliminary Support

Preliminary Support (PS) represents the first significant buying interest that appears during a downtrend, marking the initial indication that professional operators are beginning to recognize value and establish positions. While the PS does not stop the decline completely, it creates a temporary pause or slowing of the downward momentum, foreshadowing the eventual bottom that will form at the [[Selling Climax]] (SC).

## Characteristics of Preliminary Support

A valid PS event exhibits several key characteristics:

1. **Position in Downtrend**: Occurs during an established downtrend, not at random low points
2. **Increased Volume**: Volume expands compared to recent down bars, often reaching [[High Volume]] levels
3. **Wide Down Spread**: Typically shows a wide range reflecting continued selling pressure
4. **Temporary Pause**: Price may stabilize briefly or rally modestly after the PS
5. **Insufficient to Stop Decline**: The buying is not strong enough to halt the downtrend completely

The PS represents professional operators beginning to accumulate, but they are not yet aggressive enough to absorb all selling—this aggressive absorption comes later at the SC.

## Role in Phase A Accumulation

Preliminary Support is the opening act of [[Phase A]] accumulation. The typical sequence is:

1. **PS**: Initial buying interest during downtrend
2. **Continued Decline**: Price continues lower despite the PS pause
3. **[[Selling Climax]]** (SC): Panic selling reaches climax, professionals absorb aggressively
4. **[[Automatic Rally]]** (AR): Relief rally follows SC as selling pressure is exhausted
5. **[[Secondary Test]]** (ST): Return toward SC low to test if selling is truly exhausted

The PS establishes context for what follows—it shows that professionals are watching and beginning to participate, even though they are not yet ready to stop the decline. This preliminary positioning allows them to accumulate some shares before the SC, when prices may gap or move quickly.

## Volume and Price Action

The volume characteristics at PS are significant:

- **Increased vs. Recent Bars**: Volume should expand meaningfully compared to the prior down bars
- **Less Than SC Volume**: PS volume is typically lower than the eventual [[Climactic Volume]] at SC
- **Professional Presence**: The volume increase indicates institutional participants are beginning to bid

The price action shows a wide down spread indicating that sellers are still in control, but the volume expansion reveals that buyers are beginning to absorb some of the supply. This creates the temporary pause or minor rally that follows the PS.

## Distinguishing PS from Random Support

Not every temporary support during a downtrend constitutes a Preliminary Support event. Valid PS requires:

- **Subsequent Selling Climax**: There must be further decline leading to an SC event
- **Phase A Context**: Must appear in the context of trend transition, not mid-downtrend consolidation
- **Volume Confirmation**: Must show increased institutional participation
- **Logical Retrospective**: Looking back after SC, the PS should make sense as the beginning of accumulation

Many apparent support points during downtrends are merely temporary pauses that do not lead to accumulation structures. True PS events are recognized retrospectively as the beginning of a complete [[Phase A]] → [[Phase B]] → [[Phase C]] accumulation sequence.

## Trading Implications

Preliminary Support does not provide entry signals. Attempting to buy at PS is premature because:

1. The downtrend has not been definitively stopped
2. The [[Selling Climax]] has not occurred, meaning more decline is likely
3. The [[Trading Range]] has not yet been established
4. Risk parameters cannot be clearly defined without SC low

Traders should observe PS as indication that accumulation may be beginning, but should wait for:

- SC to establish the low
- [[Automatic Rally]] to confirm absorption
- [[Phase B]] range development to provide structure
- [[Phase C]] testing to validate accumulation
- [[Sign of Strength]] to provide entry signals

The PS is primarily an analytical observation rather than an actionable signal—it helps traders identify when accumulation structures are beginning to form.

## Multiple PS Events

Some accumulation structures show multiple PS events during the descent toward the eventual SC. Each represents increasing professional interest:

- **First PS**: Initial recognition of value
- **Second PS**: Increased commitment, often with higher volume
- **Final PS**: Precedes the SC by a short period

Multiple PS events can indicate that professionals are building positions over time rather than waiting for a single climactic opportunity. This can lead to a more complex [[Phase A]] structure with several legs down, each showing preliminary support characteristics.

## Relationship to Selling Climax

The PS and SC are complementary events within Phase A:

| Characteristic | PS | SC |
|---------------|----|----|
| Position | Earlier in downtrend | Terminal point of downtrend |
| Volume | Elevated | [[Climactic Volume]] |
| Price Action | Wide down spread | Very wide down spread (panic) |
| Effect | Temporary pause | Stops decline |
| Professional Behavior | Beginning to accumulate | Aggressive absorption |

The PS sets the stage for the SC by demonstrating that professionals are watching and beginning to participate. When the SC arrives with its climactic volume and wide spread, professionals aggressively complete their initial accumulation, absorbing the panic selling that the PS buyers were not yet ready to absorb.

## Application in Pattern Recognition

The Wyckoff application's pattern recognition system does not typically flag PS events automatically, as they are difficult to identify in real-time without knowing whether an SC will follow. However, retrospective analysis after identifying an accumulation structure can locate the PS events, which provide valuable context for understanding how the accumulation developed.

Advanced traders studying chart patterns manually can look for PS characteristics when analyzing potential accumulation structures, using the presence and quality of PS events to validate the overall accumulation hypothesis.
