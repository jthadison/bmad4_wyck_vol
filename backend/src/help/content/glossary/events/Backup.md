# BU - Backup (Throwback)

A Backup (BU), also called a throwback, is a temporary pullback that occurs after a [[Jump]] breakout from an accumulation structure, returning price to or near the breakout level before markup resumes. The Backup provides a final low-risk entry opportunity for traders who missed the initial breakout, allowing entry near structural support with a clearly defined stop loss. Not all accumulation structures produce Backups—some breakouts continue directly into markup without significant retracements.

## Characteristics of Backup

A valid Backup exhibits several key characteristics:

1. **After Jump Breakout**: Occurs following successful breakout above resistance
2. **Returns to Breakout Level**: Price pulls back to or slightly below the former resistance (now support)
3. **Reduced Volume**: Volume typically lower than the Jump breakout, ideally showing [[No Supply]]
4. **Narrow Spread**: Compressed range indicating lack of selling pressure
5. **Support Holds**: Price finds support at or near the breakout level
6. **Resumes Markup**: After the Backup, markup continues higher

The Backup serves to test whether the breakout was genuine and whether professionals will support the new support level.

## Mechanism of the Backup

The Backup occurs through natural profit-taking and testing dynamics:

1. **Jump Breakout**: Price breaks above accumulation range resistance
2. **Initial Markup**: Early participants take profits after quick gains
3. **Pullback Begins**: Profit-taking causes temporary retracement
4. **Return to Breakout**: Price returns to the former resistance level
5. **Professional Support**: Professionals support the level, preventing deeper decline
6. **Volume Confirms**: Low volume demonstrates no supply pressing market
7. **Markup Resumes**: With support confirmed, markup continues

This mechanism allows the market to digest the breakout and provides confirmation that professionals are committed to the markup.

## Backup vs. Failed Breakout

Not all pullbacks after breakouts are healthy Backups. Distinguishing valid Backups from failed breakouts is critical:

| Characteristic | Valid Backup | Failed Breakout |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Volume on Pullback | Low ([[No Supply]]) | High (supply present) |
| Support Level | Holds at/near breakout | Breaks back into range |
| Spread | Narrow | May be wide |
| Recovery | Quick resume of markup | Fails to advance or declines further |
| Context | After genuine accumulation | After false breakout or [[Up Thrust]] |

Failed breakouts represent false [[Jump]] signals where apparent accumulation was actually distribution. When a pullback shows high volume and breaks back into the range, the accumulation hypothesis is invalidated.

## Relationship to Last Point of Support

The Backup can be considered a type of [[Last Point of Support]] (LPS) event:

**LPS Categories**:
1. **Before Jump**: Tests after [[Spring]] or [[Sign of Strength]], before breakout
2. **Backup (After Jump)**: Throwback after breakout (this article's focus)

Both provide low-risk entry opportunities with defined stop placement. The Backup LPS is particularly attractive because:

- The breakout has validated the accumulation structure
- Risk is clearly defined (stop below Backup low)
- Entry is near support, far from resistance
- Probability is high after confirmed Jump

## Volume Analysis

Volume characteristics during the Backup provide critical validation:

**Ideal Backup Volume**:
- Significantly reduced from Jump breakout volume
- Often <50% of Jump volume
- Shows [[No Supply]] or [[Low Volume]]
- Demonstrates professionals not selling despite pullback

**Volume Pattern**:
```
Jump Volume → Backup Volume Reduction

Excellent: Backup <40% of Jump volume
Good: Backup 40%-60% of Jump volume
Acceptable: Backup 60%-80% of Jump volume
Concerning: Backup >80% of Jump volume
```

Higher volume during the Backup warns that supply may be present and the breakout could fail.

## Entry Timing

The Backup provides specific entry opportunities:

**Entry Methods**:

1. **Support Bounce**: Enter when price bounces from the breakout level
   - Pros: Confirms support is holding
   - Cons: May miss entry if no deep pullback occurs

2. **Volume Confirmation**: Enter when pullback shows low volume
   - Pros: Validates No Supply condition
   - Cons: Requires monitoring in real-time

3. **Limit Order**: Place buy order at breakout level
   - Pros: Ensures entry near optimal price
   - Cons: May not fill if Backup doesn't reach level

**Stop Loss Placement**:
- Below Backup low (if clearly defined)
- Below breakout level (former resistance)
- Below recent [[Spring]] low (if still nearby)

Tight stops are possible because the breakout level provides clear invalidation—if price breaks back below, the Jump was false.

## Not All Breakouts Have Backups

Traders should understand that Backups are common but not universal:

**Strong Breakouts Without Backup**:
- Very strong professional demand
- Institutional buying too aggressive to allow pullback
- Gap breakouts that never fill
- Momentum too strong for retracement

**Why Some Breakouts Lack Backup**:
- All accumulation completed before breakout
- Professional conviction extremely high
- External catalyst drives immediate markup
- Supply completely exhausted

Traders waiting for a Backup may miss entries entirely if the markup is relentless. This trade-off requires judgment: wait for the ideal Backup entry or take the Jump breakout entry with wider stop.

## Multiple Backups

Some accumulation structures show multiple Backup events during early markup:

**First Backup**:
- Immediately after Jump
- Tests breakout level
- Highest probability entry

**Subsequent Backups**:
- Later pullbacks during Phase D markup
- May test [[Last Point of Support]] levels
- Each should show progressively lower volume
- Confirm structural support levels

Multiple successful Backups (holding support with low volume) strengthen the bullish case and validate the campaign structure.

## Trading Implications

When a Backup develops:

1. **Entry Opportunity**: Low-risk entry near support
2. **Stop Definition**: Clear invalidation level below Backup low
3. **Risk/Reward**: Favorable due to proximity to support
4. **Probability Boost**: Breakout + successful test increases confidence
5. **Position Sizing**: Can justify larger positions due to defined risk

The Backup is often preferred to the Jump entry because:
- Risk is smaller (entry closer to support)
- Validation is greater (both breakout and successful test confirmed)
- Stop placement is clearer and tighter

However, traders must accept that some breakouts won't provide Backup opportunities.

## Failed Backup

A failed Backup occurs when:

- Price breaks back below the breakout level with volume
- Returns into the accumulation range
- Shows supply rather than [[No Supply]]
- Subsequent action weakens rather than strengthens

Failed Backups invalidate the Jump breakout and suggest the accumulation hypothesis was incorrect. The appropriate response is to exit positions and reassess whether the structure was actually distribution disguised as accumulation.

## Application in Campaign Management

When managing active campaigns:

**Backup as Entry**:
- Adds to position after Jump breakout confirmed
- Lowers average entry price
- Reduces portfolio heat (closer stop)
- Increases position size within risk limits

**Backup Monitoring**:
- If campaign entered at Jump, use Backup to assess health
- Successful Backup (low volume, holds support) → positive sign
- Failed Backup (high volume, breaks support) → exit signal

The Backup provides both entry opportunity and health validation for active campaigns.

## Professional vs. Retail Behavior

The Backup exemplifies behavioral differences:

**Retail Traders**:
- Often panic during Backup, seeing it as breakdown
- May sell positions taken at Jump breakout
- Fail to recognize normal testing behavior
- Miss the entry opportunity Backup provides

**Professional Operators**:
- Understand Backup is normal and healthy
- May add positions during Backup
- Support the breakout level to validate structure
- Hold Jump positions through normal retracement

This divergence creates the low-volume characteristic of Backups—professionals hold positions while retail traders may panic-sell, but not enough supply exists to drive price significantly lower.

## Confidence Scoring

High-confidence Backup entries exhibit:

- Clear Jump breakout preceded Backup
- Backup volume <50% of Jump volume
- Narrow spread during Backup (lack of selling pressure)
- Support holds at or just below breakout level
- Quick recovery and markup resumption

These characteristics receive elevated confidence scores in the Wyckoff application's pattern recognition, often qualifying for HIGH confidence tier (≥70%) and justifying larger position sizes within risk management constraints.
