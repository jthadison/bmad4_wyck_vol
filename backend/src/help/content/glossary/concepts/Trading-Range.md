# Trading Range

A trading range is a horizontal consolidation period where price oscillates between defined support and resistance levels while professional money accumulates or distributes positions. In Wyckoff methodology, trading ranges are not merely pauses in trending markets but rather purposeful structures where the "cause" is built that will later be expressed as "effect" through directional movement. Understanding trading range dynamics is fundamental to successful Wyckoff analysis, as the majority of significant trends emerge from well-defined ranges.

The trading range structure develops through distinct phases that reflect the changing balance between supply and demand. [[Phase A]] establishes the boundaries through climactic action that stops the prior trend. [[Phase B]] represents the cause-building period where professionals accumulate or distribute, creating a horizontal price structure as they absorb available supply or distribution. [[Phase C]] tests the range boundaries through patterns like the [[Spring]] or [[UTAD]], confirming the professional hypothesis. Finally, [[Phase D]] and Phase E represent the transition to trending as the cause is released as effect through markup or markdown.

The width and duration of a trading range directly correlate to the magnitude of the subsequent trend, embodying Wyckoff's Law of Cause and Effect. A narrow range of short duration produces a limited move, while a wide range maintained over an extended period generates significant trending potential. This relationship allows traders to set objective profit targets by measuring the range width and projecting it in the direction of the breakout. The [[Jump]] target, calculated as the range height added to the breakout point, provides a quantitative estimate of the potential effect from the cause built during consolidation.

Successful trading range analysis requires distinguishing accumulation from distribution. Accumulation ranges typically form after downtrends, feature testing of the lower boundary with diminishing volume, and ultimately break out to the upside on increased volume. Distribution ranges form after uptrends, demonstrate weakness on tests of resistance, and break down on expanding volume. However, ranges can be deceptive—what appears to be accumulation may actually be distribution, which is why patterns like springs and UTADs serve as critical confirmations. The trader who correctly identifies the character of the trading range and waits patiently for the appropriate Phase C and Phase D patterns gains a substantial edge in predicting the direction and magnitude of the subsequent trend.
