# Phase E: Trend Confirmation

Phase E represents the full expression of the trend initiated in Phase D, where the cause built during the trading range is realized as effect through sustained directional movement. This phase demonstrates the power of Wyckoff's Law of Cause and Effect: the larger the cause (width and duration of the trading range), the greater the effect (magnitude and duration of the trend). Phase E is where the majority of the profit potential from the Wyckoff cycle is realized.

During Phase E, price typically makes a series of higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend (or lower lows and lower highs in a downtrend) with minimal resistance. Public participation increases as the trend becomes obvious, providing the liquidity that allows professionals to begin distributing their accumulated positions. The trend remains healthy as long as pullbacks are orderly, volume expands on advances and contracts on corrections, and price continues to meet or exceed the targets projected from the original trading range.

As Phase E matures, traders must remain vigilant for signs of distribution that indicate the trend is entering exhaustion. These signals include climactic volume on advances without corresponding price progress, widening of spreads followed by reversals, and the emergence of resistance levels that price struggles to overcome. When a new trading range begins to form at higher levels, Phase E is transitioning into Phase A of a distribution cycle, and the markup phase is complete.

The transition from Phase E back to Phase A is not always clear in real-time, which is why mechanical profit targets and trailing stops become important. Traders who understand the full Wyckoff cycle recognize that Phase E, while profitable, is also the phase where late entrants are most vulnerable. By the time the trend is obvious to the public, professionals are preparing to distribute their positions into the buying enthusiasm, setting the stage for the next cycle to begin.
