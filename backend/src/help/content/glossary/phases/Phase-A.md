# Phase A: Stopping Action

Phase A marks the critical transition point where the previous trend loses momentum and begins to reverse. This phase represents the stopping action of the prior trend, whether it was a downtrend (accumulation) or an uptrend (distribution). During this phase, professional money begins to absorb supply or distribution from the public, creating the foundation for the next directional move.

In accumulation, Phase A begins with Preliminary Support (PS), where initial buying interest emerges to slow the downtrend. This is followed by the [[Selling Climax]] (SC), a dramatic price drop on heavy volume that represents panic selling by the public and aggressive buying by professionals. The immediate bounce from the SC creates the [[Automatic Rally]] (AR), establishing the upper boundary of the emerging trading range. The range is then tested through a [[Secondary Test]] (ST), which returns to the SC area on reduced volume, confirming that selling pressure has been exhausted.

In distribution, the sequence mirrors accumulation but in reverse. Preliminary Supply (PSY) represents initial selling by professionals, followed by a Buying Climax (BC) where public enthusiasm peaks. The Automatic Reaction (AR) establishes support, and Secondary Tests confirm that buying pressure is diminishing. Understanding Phase A is crucial because it identifies the earliest signs that the market character is changing from trending to ranging behavior.

The completion of Phase A does not guarantee a reversal, but it does signal that the previous trend has lost its momentum. Traders should watch for the characteristic volume patterns and price structures that define this phase, as they provide the first evidence that professional money is beginning to position for the next major move. Phase A sets the stage for the [[Trading Range]] that will develop in Phase B.
