# Phase C: The Test

Phase C represents the critical testing phase where the market undergoes a final shakeout or exhaustion move before transitioning to trending behavior. This phase is characterized by a violation of the [[Trading Range]] boundaries established in Phase A and maintained through Phase B. In accumulation, this manifests as a [[Spring]], while in distribution, it appears as an [[UTAD]] (Upthrust After Distribution).

The [[Spring]] pattern is the hallmark of Phase C accumulation. Price penetrates below the [[Creek]] support level, triggering stops and creating fear among retail traders who exit their positions. However, professional money uses this weakness to complete their accumulation, resulting in a rapid reversal back into the range on reduced volume. The spring serves a dual purpose: it allows smart money to acquire final positions at favorable prices while simultaneously shaking out weak holders who might sell during the subsequent markup phase. The spring must demonstrate stopping volume characteristics—heavy selling that fails to drive prices significantly lower—to be considered valid.

In distribution, Phase C features the UTAD pattern, where price thrusts above resistance but quickly fails. This false breakout traps late buyers and allows professionals to complete their distribution at elevated prices. Like the spring, the UTAD should occur on climactic volume followed by a rapid reversal, indicating that demand has been exhausted.

Phase C is the most critical phase for traders to identify because it provides the final opportunity to enter positions before the trending move begins in Phase D. However, distinguishing a valid spring or UTAD from a genuine breakout requires careful analysis of volume characteristics, the depth of the violation, and the speed of the reversal. Failed springs that violate [[Ice]] levels indicate the range structure has broken down and the accumulation or distribution hypothesis should be abandoned.
