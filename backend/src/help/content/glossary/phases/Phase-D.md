# Phase D: Trend Emergence

Phase D marks the transition from range-bound consolidation to directional trending as the cause built during Phase B is released as effect. This phase is characterized by the emergence of professional markup or markdown, with price action demonstrating clear dominance of demand over supply (accumulation) or supply over demand (distribution). Phase D provides the clearest trading opportunities in the Wyckoff cycle.

In accumulation, Phase D begins with a [[SOS]] (Sign of Strength), a decisive breakout above resistance on increased volume. The SOS represents professional money aggressively pushing price higher, overwhelming any remaining supply. Following the SOS, price typically returns to retest the breakout area in what is known as the [[Last Point of Support]] (LPS). The LPS provides a lower-risk entry opportunity compared to the SOS itself, as it offers a defined risk point (the breakout level) and allows traders to enter closer to support.

The key distinguishing feature of Phase D is the increasing ease of movement in the direction of the new trend. Where Phase B was characterized by slow, grinding price action with frequent reversals, Phase D shows sustained movement with pullbacks that are shallow and brief. Volume patterns support the new trend direction, with increased activity on advances and diminished volume on corrections in an uptrend. The [[Jump]] target, calculated as the width of the trading range projected upward from the breakout point, provides an objective measure of the potential move.

Multiple SOS and LPS events may occur during Phase D as the trend establishes itself. Each successful test of support on reduced volume provides confirmation that professional accumulation was successful and that the markup phase will continue. Traders should focus on entering at LPS points rather than chasing SOS breakouts, as this approach offers superior risk-reward ratios and reduces the likelihood of being caught in false breakouts.
