# Signal Confidence Score

The Signal Confidence Score is a 120-point scoring system that evaluates signal quality across multiple dimensions including volume behavior, structural characteristics, and market context. This quantitative framework provides traders with an objective measure of signal strength, allowing them to filter opportunities and allocate capital based on setup quality rather than subjective judgment. The confidence score transforms Wyckoff pattern recognition from a discretionary art into a systematic process.

The 120-point system allocates scoring across three primary categories, each weighted to reflect its importance in validating Wyckoff patterns. Volume analysis typically accounts for 40-50 points, evaluating whether the volume behavior supports the pattern's requirements—for example, heavy volume on the initial [[Spring]] violation followed by diminishing volume on the reversal. Structural scoring examines the pattern's technical characteristics, including the depth of violations, the speed of reversals, and the relationship to key levels like [[Creek]] and [[Ice]]. Context scoring considers the broader market environment, including the phase progression, the quality of the preceding [[Trading Range]], and the presence of supporting or contradicting signals.

The interpretation of confidence scores follows a tiered framework. Scores of 70-79 indicate acceptable signals that meet minimum requirements but may have some weaknesses in volume confirmation or structural quality. Scores of 80-89 represent good signals with solid volume confirmation and proper structural characteristics—these form the core of tradeable opportunities. Scores of 90 and above indicate excellent signals that demonstrate textbook characteristics across all dimensions; these rare setups warrant larger position sizes and higher conviction. Signals scoring below 70 should generally be avoided, as they indicate significant deficiencies in pattern quality.

The confidence scoring system serves multiple purposes beyond simple signal filtering. By quantifying signal quality, it enables position sizing strategies that allocate more capital to higher-confidence setups and less to marginal opportunities. It facilitates systematic backtesting and optimization, as the scoring rules can be refined based on historical performance data. Most importantly, it removes emotion from the evaluation process—a signal with a confidence score of 92 receives the same positive assessment whether the market has been trending for weeks or has just experienced a sharp reversal. This objectivity is crucial for maintaining discipline and executing the strategy consistently across varying market conditions.
