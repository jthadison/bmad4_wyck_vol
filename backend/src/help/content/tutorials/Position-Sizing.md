# Position Sizing

Master position sizing to optimize returns while protecting capital through proper risk management.

## Step 1: Understanding Portfolio Heat

Portfolio heat is the total capital at risk across all open positions.

<!-- action: Open risk dashboard to view current portfolio heat -->

Maximum recommended portfolio heat: 5-8% of total capital.

## Step 2: The 2% Rule

Never risk more than 2% of your portfolio on any single position.

Example: $100,000 portfolio = $2,000 max risk per position

This ensures you can withstand multiple losses without significant drawdown.

## Step 3: Calculate R-Multiple

R (Risk) is the distance from entry to stop in dollar terms.

<!-- action: Measure entry to stop distance on chart -->

Entry: $50.00
Stop: $48.00
R = $2.00 per share

## Step 4: Determine Position Size

Position Size = (Portfolio × Risk%) / R

Example:
- Portfolio: $100,000
- Risk: 2% = $2,000
- R: $2.00 per share
- Position Size: $2,000 / $2.00 = 1,000 shares

## Step 5: Check Campaign Allocation

Ensure the position fits within your campaign allocation limits.

<!-- action: Review campaign tracker for allocation -->

Don't overconcentrate in a single campaign (max 3-4 positions per campaign).

## Step 6: Verify Portfolio Heat

Add this new position's risk to existing open positions.

<!-- action: Check total portfolio heat after adding position -->

If total heat exceeds 5%, consider:
- Reducing position size
- Closing a position with weak performance
- Waiting for better risk/reward opportunity

## Step 7: Account for Correlation

Positions in the same sector/campaign are correlated and amplify risk.

If adding to existing campaign:
- Reduce individual position size
- Ensure combined heat doesn't exceed 4-5%
- Monitor for sector-wide risks

## Step 8: Execute the Trade

With position size calculated, place your order.

<!-- action: Enter order with calculated share quantity -->

Market order for liquid stocks, limit order for thin markets.

## Step 9: Record the Trade

Document the trade in your journal with R-multiple expectation.

Target: 3R (3× your risk)
Stop: -1R (your defined risk)

This creates positive expectancy over many trades.
