# Identifying SOS Signals

Master the art of identifying genuine Sign of Strength (SOS) breakouts from accumulation.

## Step 1: Understanding SOS Context

SOS (Sign of Strength) occurs in Phase D when price breaks above the trading range resistance.

<!-- action: Open the glossary entry for SOS -->

The SOS is the first major test of whether the accumulation is ready for markup.

## Step 2: Locate the Trading Range

First, identify the clear trading range boundaries (Creek/Ice levels).

<!-- action: Navigate to a signal with clear Creek/Ice levels -->

SOS should break decisively above the resistance (Ice) level.

## Step 3: Validate Volume on Breakout

Check that volume expands significantly on the breakout bar.

<!-- action: Check the volume panel for the breakout bar -->

Volume should be at least 1.5x the average volume during accumulation.

## Step 4: Check Price Action After Breakout

Observe how price behaves immediately after the SOS.

Ideal: Price continues higher or consolidates just above breakout level.
Warning: Immediate reversal back into range suggests false breakout.

## Step 5: Look for LPS Confirmation

After SOS, watch for Last Point of Support (LPS) - a pullback that holds above the breakout level.

<!-- action: Scroll forward in time to see if LPS forms -->

LPS validates the SOS and provides lower-risk entry opportunity.

## Step 6: Evaluate Confidence Score

Review the confidence score for the SOS signal.

High-quality SOS signals score 85%+ with:
- High volume (40 points)
- Decisive breakout (35 points)
- Clean follow-through (25 points)
