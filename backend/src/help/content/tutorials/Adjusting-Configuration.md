# Adjusting Configuration

This tutorial shows you how to configure the Wyckoff pattern detection system.

## Step 1: Open Configuration Wizard

Navigate to Settings and open the Configuration Wizard.

<!-- action: Click Configuration in the settings menu -->

## Step 2: Review Timeframe Settings

Check your current timeframe settings for pattern detection.

Default is Daily bars, but you can adjust based on trading style.

## Step 3: Adjust Volume Threshold

Set the minimum volume threshold for pattern detection.

<!-- action: Adjust the volume slider -->

Higher thresholds reduce false signals but may miss opportunities.

## Step 4: Configure Creek Penetration Depth

Set acceptable penetration depth for Spring/UTAD detection.

Typical range: 2-5% penetration.

## Step 5: Save Configuration

Save your changes and verify they're applied.

<!-- action: Click Save Configuration -->

## Step 6: Verify Changes

Check that new signals reflect your updated configuration.
