# Reviewing Your First Signal

This tutorial will walk you through reviewing your first trading signal in the BMAD Wyckoff system.

## Step 1: Navigate to Signals Dashboard

First, navigate to the signals dashboard from the main navigation menu.

<!-- action: Click on the Signals link in the navigation -->

The signals dashboard shows all detected Wyckoff patterns with their confidence scores and risk levels.

## Step 2: Select a Signal

Find a signal in the list and click on it to view details.

<!-- action: Click on the first signal in the list -->

Each signal displays the detected pattern type (Spring, UTAD, SOS, or LPS), the confidence score, and associated risk metrics.

## Step 3: Review Confidence Score

The confidence score represents the quality of the detected pattern based on multiple factors.

<!-- action: Hover over the confidence score to see the breakdown -->

Confidence scores are calculated from:
- Volume analysis (40 points)
- Penetration depth and recovery (35 points)
- Price action characteristics (25 points)
- Bonus points for exceptional patterns

## Step 4: Check Creek and Ice Levels

Review the Creek and Ice levels displayed on the chart.

<!-- action: Locate the Creek and Ice level indicators on the chart -->

The Creek represents support (for accumulation) or resistance (for distribution). The Ice is the critical structural level.

## Step 5: Understand Risk Calculation

View the risk metrics including R (initial risk) and portfolio heat contribution.

<!-- action: Scroll to the Risk Metrics section -->

Risk is calculated using structural stops based on Wyckoff levels, not arbitrary percentages.

## Step 6: View Chart Overlay

Examine the chart with Wyckoff markup overlays showing the pattern context.

<!-- action: Use the chart zoom and pan controls to examine the pattern -->

The chart displays:
- Trading range boundaries
- Creek and Ice levels
- Pattern entry and stop zones
- Volume characteristics

## Step 7: Make a Decision

Based on the signal quality, confidence score, and risk metrics, decide whether to act on this signal.

Remember: High confidence (>85%) with acceptable portfolio heat (<2%) generally indicates higher quality setups.
