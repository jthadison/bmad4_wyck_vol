# Understanding Pattern Confidence

Learn what confidence scores mean and how they're calculated.

## Step 1: What Confidence Scores Mean

Confidence scores range from 0-100% and indicate pattern quality.

<!-- action: Open a signal and locate the confidence score -->

- Below 70%: Weak pattern, higher risk
- 70-85%: Moderate quality
- Above 85%: High quality setup

## Step 2: Volume Component (40 points)

Volume contributes up to 40 points to the total confidence score.

<!-- action: View the volume analysis section -->

High volume on key events (Spring penetration, SOS breakout) increases confidence.

## Step 3: Penetration Component (35 points)

Penetration depth and recovery shape contribute 35 points.

Ideal penetration: Deep enough to shake out weak hands, not so deep to invalidate the pattern.

## Step 4: Recovery Component (25 points)

How price recovers after the key event contributes 25 points.

Quick, decisive recoveries score higher than slow, grinding recoveries.

## Step 5: Bonus Points

Exceptional patterns can earn bonus points for:
- Ultra-high volume (>2x average)
- Perfect penetration depth
- Textbook recovery shape

## Step 6: Interpreting 70% vs 95%

70% confidence: Acceptable pattern but watch carefully
95% confidence: Textbook example, highest probability

Always consider confidence in context with other factors like portfolio heat and risk.
