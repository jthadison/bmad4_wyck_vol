# Identifying LPS Entries

Master the highest-probability entry technique: Last Point of Support (LPS) after Sign of Strength.

## Step 1: What is LPS?

Last Point of Support (LPS) is a pullback to support after an SOS breakout.

<!-- action: Open glossary entry for LPS -->

LPS represents the final opportunity to enter before markup accelerates.

## Step 2: Wait for SOS First

LPS only occurs after a valid SOS (Sign of Strength) breakout.

<!-- action: Locate a signal with confirmed SOS -->

Never enter on LPS without first confirming the SOS breakout with volume.

## Step 3: Identify the Pullback

After SOS, price pulls back toward the breakout level (former resistance, now support).

<!-- action: Observe the pullback on the chart -->

Look for:
- Pullback to or near the breakout level
- Lower volume on the pullback (profit-taking, not distribution)
- Support holds above the former resistance

## Step 4: Check Volume on Test

Volume should contract during the pullback and expand on the bounce.

<!-- action: Check volume during pullback and bounce -->

Low volume pullback + high volume bounce = strong LPS confirmation.

## Step 5: Evaluate Support Level

The strongest LPS entries occur when price tests the exact breakout level and bounces.

Ideal zones:
- Previous resistance (Ice) level
- Round numbers / psychological levels
- Areas of previous Spring tests

## Step 6: Define Your Stop

Place structural stop just below the LPS low.

<!-- action: Mark the LPS low for stop placement -->

This gives a tight stop with favorable risk/reward ratio.

## Step 7: Calculate Position Size

Use the distance from entry to stop to calculate position size.

<!-- action: Open position sizing calculator -->

Maintain 2% portfolio risk per position maximum.

## Step 8: Monitor Follow-Through

After entry on LPS, watch for continuation higher.

Strong LPS entries show:
- Quick move away from entry
- Minimal heat on the position
- Higher highs and higher lows
