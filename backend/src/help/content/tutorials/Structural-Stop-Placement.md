# Structural Stop Placement

Master the art of placing stops at logical structural levels to avoid premature stop-outs.

## Step 1: What is a Structural Stop?

A structural stop is placed just beyond a key support/resistance level that would invalidate the setup.

<!-- action: Open glossary entry for Structural-Stop -->

Structural stops honor the logic of the pattern, not arbitrary percentages.

## Step 2: Identify the Key Structure

Locate the critical support level that defines the pattern validity.

<!-- action: Examine the chart for Creek/Ice levels -->

For Spring entries: Stop below the Spring low
For LPS entries: Stop below the LPS low or former resistance

## Step 3: Add Breathing Room

Place stop slightly below (2-3%) the structural level to avoid false triggers.

<!-- action: Calculate 2-3% below the structural level -->

Market noise and volatility can cause brief penetrations without invalidating the pattern.

## Step 4: Consider Volume Profile

Check volume at the structural level - low volume areas provide less support.

High volume nodes act as stronger support and may require less breathing room.

## Step 5: Validate with ATR

Use Average True Range (ATR) to confirm your stop placement allows for normal volatility.

<!-- action: Check ATR indicator -->

Stop should be at least 1.5x ATR away from entry to avoid noise.

## Step 6: Calculate Position Size

With stop placement defined, calculate position size to risk no more than 2% of portfolio.

<!-- action: Use position sizing calculator -->

Position Size = (Portfolio × 2%) / (Entry Price - Stop Price)

## Step 7: Set and Monitor

Set your stop order and avoid moving it closer to price (only trail up, never down).

<!-- action: Place stop-loss order at calculated level -->

Honor your stops - they protect capital for the next opportunity.
