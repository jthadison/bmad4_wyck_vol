# Identifying Springs

This tutorial teaches you to recognize authentic Wyckoff Spring patterns in Phase C accumulation.

## Step 1: Recognize Trading Range

First, identify a clear trading range (Phase B) with defined support and resistance levels.

<!-- action: Look at the chart and identify horizontal consolidation -->

The range should show multiple tests of support and resistance with declining volume.

## Step 2: Identify Creek Support Level

The Creek is the support level that will be penetrated during the Spring test.

<!-- action: Mark the lowest point of support in the trading range -->

The Creek is typically the lowest swing low in Phase B.

## Step 3: Spot Penetration Below Creek

Watch for a price move that breaks below the Creek level. This is the "shakeout" move.

<!-- action: Identify the bar that penetrates below Creek -->

A valid Spring penetrates Creek but doesn't go too deep (typically <5% below).

## Step 4: Analyze Volume

Check the volume during the Creek penetration.

<!-- action: Compare penetration volume to recent average volume -->

Ideal Springs show:
- High volume on penetration (stopping volume)
- Lower volume on recovery
- Volume climax indicating selling exhaustion

## Step 5: Check Recovery Shape

Observe how price recovers after penetrating the Creek.

<!-- action: Examine the bars immediately following the Spring -->

Strong Springs show:
- Quick recovery back above Creek
- No re-test of the low
- Tightening spreads indicating supply absorption

## Step 6: Validate Spring Criteria

Confirm all Spring characteristics are present:

1. Occurs in Phase C (after established trading range)
2. Penetrates Creek support level
3. Shows stopping volume or volume climax
4. Recovers quickly back above Creek
5. No re-test of Spring low

A pattern must meet all criteria to be considered a valid Spring.
