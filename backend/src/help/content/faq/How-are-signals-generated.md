# How are signals generated?

Signal generation in BMAD4 is a multi-stage process that combines pattern recognition, structural analysis, and confidence scoring to identify high-probability Wyckoff trading opportunities. The system continuously monitors price and volume data to detect the characteristic patterns and phase progressions that indicate professional accumulation or distribution. This automated approach ensures consistent application of Wyckoff principles while eliminating the subjectivity and emotional bias that can affect manual analysis.

The detection pipeline begins with trading range identification. The system scans price data to locate consolidation periods that meet the criteria for potential accumulation or distribution ranges, including minimum width, duration, and volume characteristics. Once a range is identified, the system classifies it by phase—tracking the progression from [[Phase A]] through Phase E—and monitors for the specific patterns associated with each phase. This includes detecting climactic action in Phase A, cause-building in [[Phase B]], test patterns like [[Spring]] or [[UTAD]] in [[Phase C]], and breakout structures like [[SOS]] and [[LPS]] in [[Phase D]].

Pattern recognition focuses on the key elements that validate Wyckoff setups. For spring patterns, the system verifies that price has penetrated the [[Creek]] support level, examines volume behavior to confirm stopping action (heavy volume that fails to drive prices lower), and validates the reversal characteristics. For SOS patterns, it confirms breakout above resistance on expanded volume. Each pattern is evaluated against multiple criteria including depth of penetration, speed of reversal, volume characteristics, and relationship to key structural levels like Creek and [[Ice]]. Patterns that fail to meet these criteria are filtered out before reaching the confidence scoring stage.

The final stage applies the [[Signal Confidence Score]] system, a 120-point framework that quantitatively evaluates signal quality across volume behavior (40-50 points), structural characteristics (40-50 points), and market context (20-30 points). Signals scoring 80 or above are presented to the trader as actionable opportunities, with higher scores indicating stronger setups. This systematic approach ensures that only signals meeting rigorous quality standards reach the trader's attention, while the quantitative scoring enables position sizing and risk allocation strategies based on setup quality. The combination of automated detection and objective scoring transforms Wyckoff pattern recognition from a subjective skill into a systematic, repeatable process.
