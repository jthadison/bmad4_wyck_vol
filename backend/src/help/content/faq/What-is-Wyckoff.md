# What is Wyckoff?

The Wyckoff Method is a comprehensive approach to market analysis developed by Richard D. Wyckoff in the early 20th century, based on decades of observation of how professional money operates in financial markets. Wyckoff sought to level the playing field between institutional operators and retail traders by teaching individuals to recognize the footprints of professional accumulation and distribution in the price and volume record. His methodology remains relevant today because it addresses the timeless dynamics of supply, demand, and human psychology that drive all markets.

At the foundation of Wyckoff's work are three fundamental laws that explain market behavior. The Law of Supply and Demand states that prices rise when demand exceeds supply and fall when supply exceeds demand—a simple principle, but one that requires careful analysis of price and volume to apply correctly. The Law of Cause and Effect posits that the magnitude of a price movement (effect) is proportional to the preparation that preceded it (cause), measured by the width and duration of the [[Trading Range]] where accumulation or distribution occurred. The Law of Effort and Result examines the relationship between volume (effort) and price movement (result), looking for harmony or divergence that reveals the true balance of power between buyers and sellers.

Wyckoff methodology divides market cycles into distinct phases that reflect the activities of the [[Composite Operator]]—the conceptual representation of professional money. [[Phase A]] marks the stopping of the prior trend through climactic action. [[Phase B]] represents the building of cause as professionals accumulate or distribute positions within a trading range. [[Phase C]] tests the range boundaries through patterns like the [[Spring]] or [[UTAD]], providing the final shakeout before the trend begins. [[Phase D]] transitions from ranging to trending as the markup or markdown emerges. Phase E expresses the full effect of the cause built during the range.

The practical application of Wyckoff analysis involves identifying which phase the market is in, recognizing the characteristic patterns of each phase, and positioning oneself to trade alongside professional money rather than against it. This means buying during accumulation (Phases A-C) before the markup begins in Phase D, and selling or avoiding long positions during distribution. By understanding the methodology's principles and patterns, traders gain a framework for interpreting market behavior that transcends specific timeframes, instruments, or market conditions. The Wyckoff Method is not a system of mechanical rules, but rather a comprehensive approach to reading markets that improves with study and experience.
