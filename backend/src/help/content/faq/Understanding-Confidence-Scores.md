# Understanding Confidence Scores

The confidence scoring system provides an objective, quantitative measure of signal quality that enables traders to filter opportunities and allocate capital based on setup strength rather than subjective judgment. The 120-point framework evaluates signals across multiple dimensions including volume behavior, structural characteristics, and market context, transforming Wyckoff pattern recognition from a discretionary skill into a systematic, repeatable process. Understanding how to interpret these scores is essential for effective use of the BMAD4 system.

The 120-point maximum is allocated across three primary scoring categories, each weighted to reflect its importance in validating Wyckoff patterns. Volume analysis typically accounts for 40-50 points, evaluating whether volume behavior confirms the pattern requirements—for example, a [[Spring]] should show heavy volume on the initial [[Creek]] violation followed by diminishing volume on the reversal, indicating absorption by professional buyers. Structural scoring (40-50 points) examines technical characteristics including the depth of violations, speed of reversals, and relationship to key levels like Creek and [[Ice]]. Context scoring (20-30 points) considers the broader environment including phase progression, quality of the preceding [[Trading Range]], and presence of supporting or contradicting signals across related timeframes or instruments.

Score interpretation follows a tiered framework that guides trade selection and position sizing. Scores of 70-79 indicate acceptable signals that meet minimum requirements but have some deficiencies—perhaps volume confirmation is adequate but not ideal, or the structural setup is valid but the range lacks significant width. These signals may be tradeable but warrant smaller positions and lower conviction. Scores of 80-89 represent good signals with solid confirmation across most criteria; these form the core of regular trading activity. Scores of 90 and above are excellent signals demonstrating textbook characteristics—these rare setups justify larger positions and highest conviction. Signals below 70 should generally be avoided as they indicate material deficiencies in pattern quality.

The practical application of confidence scores extends beyond simple filtering. Higher-confidence signals warrant larger position sizes within the constraints of individual position risk and portfolio heat limits. For example, a trader might risk 0.75% on a 75-point signal, 1% on an 85-point signal, and 1.5% on a 95-point signal. This approach allocates more capital to higher-quality setups while maintaining participation in acceptable opportunities. Score-based filtering also improves over time: by tracking the performance of signals at different score ranges, traders can calibrate their personal thresholds—some may find that in their market or timeframe, signals below 75 are not worth trading, while others may achieve adequate results at 70+. This systematic approach removes emotion from evaluation and creates a framework for continuous improvement through data-driven refinement of selection criteria.
