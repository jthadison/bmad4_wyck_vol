"""
Phase Classification data models for Wyckoff Phase Detection.

This module defines the Wyckoff phase classification models used to classify
the current market phase (A, B, C, D, E) based on detected events. Phase
classification enables FR15 (phase-pattern alignment) and FR14 (trading
restrictions) enforcement.

Wyckoff Phase Progression:
    Phase A: Stopping Action (SC + AR + ST)
    Phase B: Building Cause (ST oscillation in range, 10-40 bars)
    Phase C: Test (Spring - final shakeout)
    Phase D: Sign of Strength (SOS breakout above Ice)
    Phase E: Markup (sustained trend above Ice)

    Wyckoff phase classification result.

    Classifies the current market phase (A, B, C, D, E) based on detected
