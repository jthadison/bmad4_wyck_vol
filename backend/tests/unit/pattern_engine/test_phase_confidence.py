"""
Unit tests for Phase Confidence Scoring (Story 4.5).

Tests the confidence scoring algorithm that calculates 0-100 confidence scores
for Wyckoff phase classifications, enforcing FR3 requirement (70% minimum).

Test Coverage:
- Perfect Phase A sequence (should score 95+)
- Perfect Phase B sequence (should score 95+)
- Ambiguous phase (should score 50-60, get rejected)
- Missing events (should score <70, get rejected)
- Sequence validation scoring
- Range context scoring
- Confidence threshold enforcement (70%)
