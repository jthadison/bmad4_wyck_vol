  per_trade_maximum: 2.0  # FR18: Maximum risk per trade (percentage)
  pattern_risk_percentages:
    SPRING: 0.5  # Phase C test entry
    ST: 0.5      # Secondary Test
    LPS: 0.7     # Last Point of Support (HIGHEST allocation - best EV)
    SOS: 0.8     # Sign of Strength
    UTAD: 0.5    # Upthrust After Distribution (Phase C shorts only)

  rationale:
    SPRING: |
      Phase C test entry with tight structural stop (2% below spring_low).
      Win rate: ~70% with proper PS/SC/AR Phase A-B context.
      Risk allocation: 0.5% (conservative first entry in accumulation campaign).

      Wyckoff Context:
      The Spring is your first indication that the Composite Operator has absorbed
      supply and is ready to markup. Risk small here - you'll add at ST and LPS.

      Campaign Position: FIRST entry (establish initial position, 0.5% risk)
      Stop Structure: Spring low - 2% (tight, structural)
      Expected Value: 0.70 × 3.5R × $500 = $1,225 gross return

    ST: |
      Secondary Test validates Spring (3% below Spring low).
      Win rate: ~65-70% depending on context.
      - With validated Spring (PS/SC/AR sequence): ~70% (same as Spring)
      - Standalone ST (weak Phase C): ~60% (reduced confirmation)
      Risk allocation: 0.5% assumes mixed scenarios across all ST detections.

      Wyckoff Context:
      The Secondary Test confirms the Spring was genuine accumulation, not a bull trap.
      If ST holds above Spring low, accumulation structure is likely complete.

      Campaign Position: SECOND entry (add to Spring position, 0.5% risk)
      Stop Structure: Spring low - 3% (validates Spring support)
      Expected Value: 0.65 × 3.3R × $500 = $1,073 gross return

    LPS: |
      Last Point of Support after SOS breakout (3% below Ice).
      Win rate: ~75% (HIGHEST) - dual confirmation structure.
      Risk allocation: 0.7% (HIGHEST despite tighter stop than SOS).

      Why LPS gets MORE risk than SOS:
      1. Higher win rate (75% vs 55%) - dual confirmation reduces failure
      2. Better R-multiple (3.33R vs 2.5R) - tighter stop improves risk:reward
      3. Superior expected value: $1,573 vs $740 (112% higher than SOS)

      Position size auto-adjusts for stop width (Story 7.2), so 0.7% LPS risk
      with 3% stop produces similar dollar risk per share as 0.8% SOS with 5% stop.

      Wyckoff Context:
      "The LPS is the classic 'last chance' entry before markup accelerates.
      Old resistance (Ice) has proven itself as support. This is THE trade."

      Campaign Position: THIRD/FINAL entry (maximum confirmation, 0.7% risk)
      Stop Structure: Ice - 3% (support confirmation)
      Expected Value: 0.75 × 3.33R × $700 = $1,573 gross return (BEST)

    SOS: |
      Sign of Strength breakout entry (5% below Ice).
      Win rate: ~55% (false-breakout risk without pullback confirmation).
      Risk allocation: 0.8% (reduced from 1.0% in v1.0).

      Why SOS gets LESS risk than LPS despite wider stop:
      1. Lower win rate (55% vs 75%) - no pullback confirmation, "Jump the Creek" risk
      2. Worse R-multiple (2.5R vs 3.33R) - wider stop reduces risk:reward ratio
      3. Inferior expected value: $740 vs $1,573 (47% of LPS expected value)

      Three Wyckoff risk factors justify 0.8% (down from 1.0%):
      1. Wider structural stop (5% vs 3% LPS) = higher dollar risk per share
      2. Lower win rate (~55%) due to false-breakout risk (no LPS confirmation)
      3. Single-phase validation (SOS only) vs dual-phase (SOS + LPS)

      Wyckoff Context:
      "Entering on the SOS without waiting for the LPS is impatient trading.
      You're paying a wider stop and accepting lower probability for immediate entry."

      Campaign Position: ALTERNATIVE entry if no LPS forms (10-bar window)
      Stop Structure: Ice - 5% (wider, absorbs false-breakout risk)
      Expected Value: 0.55 × 2.5R × $800 = $740 gross return (inferior to LPS)

    UTAD: |
      Upthrust After Distribution - Phase C short entry (2% above UTAD high).
      Win rate: ~70% with proper Phase C validation (85+ confidence).
      Risk allocation: 0.5% (tight stop, but REQUIRES Phase C confirmation).

      CRITICAL: UTAD is Phase C ONLY. Do NOT short Phase A-B uptrusts.

      Phase Validation Context:
      - Proper Phase C + volume + 85+ confidence: ~70% win rate (excellent short)
      - Premature UTAD in Phase B: ~40% win rate (TRAP - price may rally)
      - Phase validation is NON-NEGOTIABLE for UTAD entries

      Wyckoff Context:
      "The Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) is the distribution equivalent of
      the Spring. It tests overhead supply one final time before markdown begins.
      Short here with a tight stop above the UTAD high, but ONLY after Phase C
      is confirmed."

      Campaign Position: SHORT entry (distribution reversal, 0.5% risk)
      Stop Structure: UTAD high + 2% (tight, structural)
      Expected Value: 0.70 × 3.5R × $500 = $1,225 gross return
      Phase Requirement: Phase C confidence ≥85% (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
