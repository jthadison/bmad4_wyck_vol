# Risk Allocation Configuration - Wyckoff Pattern-Specific Risk Percentages
# Story 7.1 | FR16: Pattern-specific risk allocation | FR18: Per-trade risk limits
#
# Risk percentages are based on structural stop loss distances combined with
# historical success probabilities for each Wyckoff pattern type.

risk_allocation:
  version: "1.2"
  per_trade_maximum: 2.0

  # AC 1: Pattern-specific risk allocation table
  # Tighter stops (Spring, UTAD) risk less capital; wider stops (SOS) risk more.
  pattern_risk_percentages:
    SPRING: 0.5
    ST: 0.5
    LPS: 0.7
    SOS: 0.8
    UTAD: 0.5

  # AC 2: Rationale for each risk allocation based on Wyckoff methodology
  rationale:
    SPRING: "0.5% risk with tight 2% stop loss. Springs have ~70% success rate when confirmed by Phase A-B structure. Low risk allocation due to tight structural stop below the shakeout low."
    ST: "0.5% risk with 3% stop loss. Secondary Tests validate the Spring with ~65% success rate. Conservative allocation as ST confirms accumulation but carries retest risk."
    LPS: "0.7% risk with 3% stop loss. Last Point of Support has ~75% success rate - highest expected value among all patterns. Pullback confirmation to broken resistance (now support) provides strong structural validation."
    SOS: "0.8% risk with wider 5% stop loss. Sign of Strength breakouts have ~55% success rate due to false-breakout risk. Higher capital allocation offsets the wider stop needed above the breakout level."
    UTAD: "0.5% risk with tight 2% stop loss. Upthrust After Distribution has ~70% success rate in Phase C distribution. Conservative allocation for short-side trades with structural stop above the failed upthrust."
