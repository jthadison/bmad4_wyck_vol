# Prometheus Alert Rules for Signal Scanner (Story 19.20)
# These rules define alerting conditions for the real-time scanner performance metrics

groups:
  - name: signal_scanner
    interval: 30s
    rules:
      # Alert when pattern detection latency p95 exceeds 500ms for 5 minutes
      - alert: HighPatternDetectionLatency
        expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(pattern_detection_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 0.5
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          component: scanner
        annotations:
          summary: "Pattern detection p95 latency > 500ms"
          description: |
            Pattern detection is taking longer than expected. Current p95: {{ $value }}s
            This may indicate system resource constraints or inefficient pattern detection logic.
            Review CPU/memory usage and consider optimizing detection algorithms.

      # Alert when no signals have been generated in 4 hours during market hours
      # NOTE: Time-based filtering (market hours only) is not implemented in the PromQL expression.
      # Use Alertmanager silence rules to prevent alerts outside market hours (e.g., weekends).
      # Alternatively, configure time_intervals in Alertmanager route config:
      #   - weekdays: ['monday:friday']
      #     times: [['09:30', '16:00']]  # US market hours
      - alert: NoSignalsGenerated
        expr: increase(signals_generated_total[4h]) == 0
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          component: scanner
        annotations:
          summary: "No signals generated in 4 hours during market hours"
          description: |
            The scanner has not generated any signals in the past 4 hours.
            This may indicate:
            - Scanner has stopped processing bars
            - Market conditions don't meet pattern criteria (normal)
            - Pattern detection logic issues
            Check scanner health and verify market data feed is active.

            Note: This alert may fire outside market hours. Configure Alertmanager
            time-based routing or silence rules to suppress alerts during non-trading hours.

      # Alert when signal rejection rate exceeds 90% for 30 minutes
      - alert: HighRejectionRate
        expr: |
          (rate(signals_rejected_total[1h]) / rate(signals_generated_total[1h])) > 0.9
          and rate(signals_generated_total[1h]) > 0
        for: 30m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          component: validation
        annotations:
          summary: "Signal rejection rate > 90%"
          description: |
            More than 90% of generated signals are being rejected.
            Current rejection rate: {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}
            This may indicate:
            - Pattern detection generating low-quality signals
            - Validation rules too strict
            - Market conditions not suitable for trading
            Review rejection reasons breakdown and adjust validation thresholds if needed.

      # Alert when scanner health check fails
      - alert: ScannerUnhealthy
        expr: scanner_health == 0
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
          component: scanner
        annotations:
          summary: "Signal scanner is unhealthy"
          description: |
            The real-time signal scanner health check is failing.
            The scanner may have crashed or entered an error state.
            Immediate action required - check scanner logs and restart if necessary.

      # Alert when validation latency is high
      - alert: HighSignalValidationLatency
        expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(signal_validation_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 0.2
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          component: validation
        annotations:
          summary: "Signal validation p95 latency > 200ms"
          description: |
            Signal validation is taking longer than expected. Current p95: {{ $value }}s
            This may delay signal notifications to users.
            Check validation pipeline performance and database query times.

      # Alert when WebSocket notification latency is high
      - alert: HighWebSocketNotificationLatency
        expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(websocket_notification_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 1.0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          component: websocket
        annotations:
          summary: "WebSocket notification p95 latency > 1s"
          description: |
            WebSocket notifications are taking longer than expected. Current p95: {{ $value }}s
            Users may experience delayed signal updates.
            Check WebSocket connection pool and network conditions.

      # Alert when too many signals are pending approval
      - alert: HighPendingSignalsCount
        expr: pending_signals_count > 50
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          component: approval_queue
        annotations:
          summary: "High number of pending signals ({{ $value }})"
          description: |
            There are {{ $value }} signals awaiting approval.
            This may indicate:
            - Users not actively approving signals
            - Signal approval UI performance issues
            - Excessive signal generation rate
            Review approval queue and consider auto-approval for high-confidence signals.

      # Alert when active symbols count drops to zero during market hours
      - alert: NoActiveSymbols
        expr: active_symbols_count == 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          component: scanner
        annotations:
          summary: "No symbols are being monitored"
          description: |
            The scanner is not monitoring any symbols.
            This may indicate:
            - All watchlist symbols were removed
            - Scanner initialization failure
            - Market data feed disconnection
            Verify watchlist configuration and scanner status.

      # Alert for sustained high signal generation rate (potential spam)
      - alert: AbnormallyHighSignalGenerationRate
        expr: sum(rate(signals_generated_total[5m])) > 10
        for: 15m
        labels:
          severity: info
          component: scanner
        annotations:
          summary: "Unusually high signal generation rate"
          description: |
            Signal generation rate is {{ $value }} signals/sec over 5 minutes.
            This is higher than normal and may indicate:
            - Highly volatile market conditions (normal)
            - Pattern detection logic generating false positives
            - Data quality issues
            Monitor signal quality and rejection rates.
