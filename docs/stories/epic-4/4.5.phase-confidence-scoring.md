# Story 4.5: Phase Confidence Scoring

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** phase detector,
**I want** to calculate confidence scores for phase identification,
**so that** only high-confidence phase classifications (70%+) are used for trading (FR3).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Function: `calculate_phase_confidence(phase, events, trading_range) -> int` returns 0-100
2. Event presence (40 points): all required events detected for phase
3. Event quality (30 points): individual event confidence scores averaged
4. Sequence validity (20 points): events occur in correct order and timing
5. Range context (10 points): phase makes sense given range structure
6. Minimum confidence: 70% required per FR3
7. Rejection logic: if confidence <70%, phase classification discarded
8. Unit test: perfect phase sequence scores 95+
9. Integration test: ambiguous phase scores 50-60, gets rejected
10. Logging: debug log for low-confidence classifications with reasons

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Define PhaseEvents data structure** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create file: `backend/src/models/phase_events.py`
  - [ ] Define Pydantic model: `class PhaseEvents(BaseModel):`
  - [ ] Add fields for all possible events:
    - `sc: Optional[SellingClimax] = None` - Selling Climax (Phase A)
    - `ar: Optional[AutomaticRally] = None` - Automatic Rally (Phase A)
    - `st_list: List[SecondaryTest] = []` - Secondary Tests (Phase B, can be multiple)
    - `spring: Optional[Spring] = None` - Spring (Phase C, from Epic 5)
    - `sos: Optional[SignOfStrength] = None` - Sign of Strength (Phase D, from Epic 5)
    - `lps: Optional[LastPointOfSupport] = None` - Last Point of Support (Phase D, from Epic 5)
  - [ ] Add helper methods:
    - `has_phase_a() -> bool`: Returns True if SC and AR both present
    - `has_phase_b() -> bool`: Returns True if Phase A confirmed and at least 1 ST
    - `has_phase_c() -> bool`: Returns True if Phase B confirmed and Spring present
    - `has_phase_d() -> bool`: Returns True if SOS present (regardless of prior phases)
  - [ ] Add docstring explaining event requirements per phase

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement `calculate_phase_confidence` function signature** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Update file: `backend/src/pattern_engine/phase_detector.py`
  - [ ] Create function: `def calculate_phase_confidence(phase: WyckoffPhase, events: PhaseEvents, trading_range: TradingRange) -> int:`
  - [ ] Add comprehensive docstring:
    - Purpose: calculate confidence score for phase classification
    - Parameters: phase (A/B/C/D/E), events (detected events), trading_range (range context)
    - Returns: int 0-100 (confidence score)
    - Algorithm: 40pts event presence + 30pts event quality + 20pts sequence + 10pts range context
    - FR3: Only phases with 70%+ confidence used for trading
  - [ ] Validate inputs:
    - phase is valid WyckoffPhase enum value
    - events is not None
    - trading_range is not None (for Phase B/C context)
  - [ ] Return int between 0-100

- [ ] **Task 3: Implement event presence scoring (40 points)** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create helper: `def _score_event_presence(phase: WyckoffPhase, events: PhaseEvents) -> int:`
  - [ ] **Phase A requirements** (SC + AR):
    - If SC present: +20 points
    - If AR present: +20 points
    - Total: 40 points if both present (Phase A confirmed)
    - Partial: 20 points if only SC (incomplete Phase A)
    - None: 0 points if neither
  - [ ] **Phase B requirements** (Phase A + at least 1 ST):
    - If Phase A confirmed (SC + AR): +20 points
    - If at least 1 ST present: +10 points
    - If 2+ STs present: +20 points (stronger cause building)
    - Total: 40 points if Phase A + 2+ STs
    - Partial: 30 points if Phase A + 1 ST
  - [ ] **Phase C requirements** (Phase B + Spring):
    - If Phase B confirmed: +20 points
    - If Spring present: +20 points
    - Total: 40 points if both
  - [ ] **Phase D requirements** (SOS):
    - If SOS present: +40 points (SOS alone defines Phase D)
    - Optional: LPS adds confirmation but not required
  - [ ] **Phase E requirements** (continuation of markup):
    - If Phase D confirmed: +20 points
    - If price above Ice level: +20 points
    - Total: 40 points
  - [ ] Return event presence score (0-40)

- [ ] **Task 4: Implement event quality scoring (30 points)** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create helper: `def _score_event_quality(phase: WyckoffPhase, events: PhaseEvents) -> int:`
  - [ ] **Extract confidence scores from events**:
    - SC has confidence score (0-100) from Story 4.1
    - AR doesn't have explicit confidence, but can assess quality:
      - Rally % > 5%: high quality (100)
      - Rally % 3-5%: medium quality (75)
      - Rally % exactly 3%: minimum quality (50)
    - ST quality based on volume reduction:
      - High reduction (>50%): high quality (100)
      - Medium reduction (25-50%): medium quality (75)
      - Low reduction (<25%): low quality (50)
    - Spring quality from Epic 5 (will have confidence score)
    - SOS quality from Epic 5 (will have confidence score)
  - [ ] **Calculate average quality for relevant events**:
    - Phase A: average(SC.confidence, AR quality)
    - Phase B: average(SC.confidence, AR quality, ST avg quality)
    - Phase C: average(all Phase B events, Spring.confidence)
    - Phase D: SOS.confidence (primary), optionally include LPS if present
    - Phase E: average(Phase D events, continuation metrics)
  - [ ] **Scale to 30 points**:
    - avg_quality (0-100) → scale to 0-30 points
    - Formula: `quality_score = (avg_quality / 100.0) * 30`
  - [ ] Return event quality score (0-30)

- [ ] **Task 5: Implement sequence validity scoring (20 points)** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create helper: `def _score_sequence_validity(phase: WyckoffPhase, events: PhaseEvents, trading_range: TradingRange) -> int:`
  - [ ] **Phase A sequence validation**:
    - SC must come before AR (SC timestamp < AR timestamp)
    - AR must be within 10 bars of SC (from Story 4.2)
    - If valid sequence: 20 points
    - If SC/AR out of order: 0 points
    - If AR too late (>10 bars): 10 points (partial credit)
  - [ ] **Phase B sequence validation**:
    - Phase A must be complete (SC + AR)
    - STs must come after AR
    - STs must be spaced reasonably (not all in 1-2 bars)
    - Duration: Phase B should be 10-40 bars (AC from Story 4.4)
    - If valid sequence + duration: 20 points
    - If sequence valid but duration off: 10-15 points
    - If sequence invalid: 0 points
  - [ ] **Phase C sequence validation**:
    - Phase B must be complete
    - Spring must come after adequate Phase B duration (at least 10 bars)
    - Spring must test SC low or Creek level
    - If valid sequence: 20 points
    - If Spring too early (<10 bars Phase B): 10 points
    - If Spring doesn't test low: 5 points
  - [ ] **Phase D sequence validation**:
    - SOS must break above Ice level (resistance)
    - SOS should come after Phase C (Spring)
    - If SOS without prior phases but breaks Ice: 15 points (valid but less confidence)
    - If full sequence A→B→C→D: 20 points (ideal)
  - [ ] **Phase E sequence validation**:
    - Must have Phase D (SOS breakout)
    - Price must be trending above Ice
    - If valid continuation: 20 points
  - [ ] Return sequence validity score (0-20)

- [ ] **Task 6: Implement range context scoring (10 points)** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create helper: `def _score_range_context(phase: WyckoffPhase, events: PhaseEvents, trading_range: TradingRange) -> int:`
  - [ ] **Check if phase makes sense given trading range**:
    - Trading range quality score (from Story 3.3)
    - Range width (Ice - Creek) adequate (3%+ from FR1)
    - Range duration matches phase expectations
  - [ ] **Phase A context**:
    - If SC low aligns with range support cluster: +5 points
    - If AR high within range: +5 points
    - Total: 10 points if well-aligned
  - [ ] **Phase B context**:
    - If STs oscillate within range (between Creek and Ice): +5 points
    - If range duration 10-40 bars: +5 points
    - Total: 10 points
  - [ ] **Phase C context**:
    - If Spring tests Creek or SC low: +5 points
    - If Spring is within range bounds: +5 points
    - Total: 10 points
  - [ ] **Phase D context**:
    - If SOS breaks above Ice with high volume: +10 points
    - If no range context (SOS in trending market): +5 points
  - [ ] **Phase E context**:
    - If price well above Ice (>3%): +10 points
    - If trending continuation: +5 points
  - [ ] Return range context score (0-10)

- [ ] **Task 7: Calculate total confidence score** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] In `calculate_phase_confidence`, call all scoring helpers:
    - `event_score = _score_event_presence(phase, events)`
    - `quality_score = _score_event_quality(phase, events)`
    - `sequence_score = _score_sequence_validity(phase, events, trading_range)`
    - `context_score = _score_range_context(phase, events, trading_range)`
  - [ ] Calculate total:
    - `total_confidence = event_score + quality_score + sequence_score + context_score`
  - [ ] Cap at 100:
    - `total_confidence = min(total_confidence, 100)`
  - [ ] Return total confidence score

- [ ] **Task 8: Implement rejection logic for low confidence** (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Define constant: `MIN_PHASE_CONFIDENCE = 70` (per FR3)
  - [ ] Create helper: `def should_reject_phase(confidence: int) -> bool:`
    - Return True if confidence < 70
    - Return False if confidence >= 70
  - [ ] In `calculate_phase_confidence`, log rejection:
    ```python
    if total_confidence < MIN_PHASE_CONFIDENCE:
        logger.warning("low_confidence_phase",
                      phase=phase.value,
                      confidence=total_confidence,
                      min_required=MIN_PHASE_CONFIDENCE,
                      event_score=event_score,
                      quality_score=quality_score,
                      sequence_score=sequence_score,
                      context_score=context_score,
                      message="Phase confidence below minimum, will be rejected")
    ```
  - [ ] Caller (Story 4.4: classify_phase) will check confidence and reject if <70%
  - [ ] Document rejection behavior in docstring

- [ ] **Task 9: Add comprehensive logging for scoring breakdown** (AC: 10)
  - [ ] Log start of confidence calculation:
    - phase, events summary (which events present)
  - [ ] Log each scoring component:
    - Event presence: score, events detected
    - Event quality: score, avg quality, individual qualities
    - Sequence validity: score, sequence check results
    - Range context: score, context check results
  - [ ] Log total confidence:
    - Total score
    - Breakdown by component
    - Pass/fail vs. 70% threshold
  - [ ] If confidence < 70%, log detailed reasons:
    - Which components scored low
    - Which events missing
    - Which sequence checks failed
  - [ ] Use structlog with correlation IDs
  - [ ] Follow logging standards from architecture/17-monitoring-and-observability.md

- [ ] **Task 10: Write unit test for perfect Phase A sequence** (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Create test file: `backend/tests/unit/pattern_engine/test_phase_confidence.py` (create new)
  - [ ] Generate perfect Phase A:
    - SC with 95 confidence (high volume, wide spread, good close position)
    - AR with 5.5% rally (high quality), 3 bars after SC (ideal timing)
    - SC before AR in sequence (valid order)
    - SC aligns with range support (good context)
  - [ ] Expected scoring:
    - Event presence: 40 points (SC + AR both present)
    - Event quality: ~28 points (avg of 95 SC + 100 AR = 97.5 → 29.25, rounds to ~29)
    - Sequence validity: 20 points (perfect timing and order)
    - Range context: 10 points (good alignment)
    - Total: ~97-99 points (≥95 per AC 8)
  - [ ] Call calculate_phase_confidence(WyckoffPhase.A, events, trading_range)
  - [ ] Assert: confidence >= 95
  - [ ] Assert: confidence passes 70% threshold

- [ ] **Task 11: Write unit test for perfect Phase B sequence** (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Generate perfect Phase B:
    - Phase A confirmed (SC + AR with high confidence)
    - 3 Secondary Tests with decreasing volume (high quality STs)
    - STs spaced 5-10 bars apart (good distribution)
    - Phase B duration: 25 bars (within 10-40 ideal range)
    - STs oscillate within trading range
  - [ ] Expected scoring:
    - Event presence: 40 points (Phase A + 2+ STs)
    - Event quality: ~28 points (high avg quality)
    - Sequence validity: 20 points (good timing, duration)
    - Range context: 10 points (STs within range)
    - Total: ~98 points (≥95 per AC 8)
  - [ ] Assert: confidence >= 95

- [ ] **Task 12: Write unit test for ambiguous phase (low confidence)** (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Generate ambiguous Phase A:
    - SC detected but with low confidence (72 - just above minimum)
    - AR detected but minimal rally (exactly 3.0%, low quality)
    - AR comes late (8 bars after SC, outside ideal 5-bar window)
    - Poor range context (SC doesn't align well with support)
  - [ ] Expected scoring:
    - Event presence: 40 points (both events present, but barely)
    - Event quality: ~18 points (avg of 72 SC + 50 AR = 61 → 18.3)
    - Sequence validity: 10 points (valid but late AR)
    - Range context: 2 points (poor alignment)
    - Total: ~70 points (borderline, might be 68-72)
  - [ ] If scored <70: Assert rejection
  - [ ] If scored >=70 but <75: Log warning about marginal confidence
  - [ ] Test that ambiguous phases around 50-60 score get rejected per AC 9

- [ ] **Task 13: Write unit test for missing events (low confidence)** (AC: 2, 7, 9)
  - [ ] Generate incomplete Phase A:
    - SC detected with high confidence (90)
    - AR missing (timeout, no demand)
    - Events: only SC, no AR
  - [ ] Expected scoring:
    - Event presence: 20 points (only SC, missing AR)
    - Event quality: 27 points (SC quality 90 → 27 points, but no AR to average)
    - Sequence validity: 0 points (can't validate sequence without AR)
    - Range context: 5 points (partial context from SC)
    - Total: ~52 points (well below 70% threshold)
  - [ ] Assert: confidence < 70
  - [ ] Assert: should_reject_phase(confidence) returns True
  - [ ] Verify log shows "missing AR" as rejection reason

- [ ] **Task 14: Write unit test for sequence validation scoring** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test valid sequence (20 points):
    - SC at bar 100, AR at bar 103 (3 bars apart)
    - SC timestamp < AR timestamp
    - AR within 5-bar ideal window
    - Assert: sequence_score == 20
  - [ ] Test delayed AR (10 points):
    - SC at bar 100, AR at bar 108 (8 bars apart, outside ideal 5)
    - Still within 10-bar timeout
    - Assert: sequence_score == 10 (partial credit)
  - [ ] Test invalid sequence (0 points):
    - AR timestamp < SC timestamp (impossible order)
    - Assert: sequence_score == 0
  - [ ] Test AR timeout (0 points):
    - SC at bar 100, AR at bar 112 (12 bars, beyond timeout)
    - Assert: sequence_score == 0 (invalid)

- [ ] **Task 15: Write unit test for range context scoring** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Test good range context (10 points):
    - SC low aligns with range support cluster (within 1%)
    - AR high within range bounds (below Ice)
    - Trading range quality >= 70
    - Assert: context_score == 10
  - [ ] Test poor range context (2-3 points):
    - SC low outside range support
    - AR high breaks above range
    - Trading range quality < 60
    - Assert: context_score <= 3
  - [ ] Test no range context (Phase D/E):
    - SOS breakout without clear range
    - Trending market, no accumulation range
    - Assert: context_score == 5 (partial credit for valid breakout)

- [ ] **Task 16: Write integration test with AAPL accumulation cycle** (AC: 8, 9)
  - [ ] Create test file: `backend/tests/integration/pattern_engine/test_phase_confidence_integration.py`
  - [ ] Load AAPL data for full accumulation cycle (e.g., Oct 2023 - Jan 2024)
  - [ ] Detect all events:
    - SC (Story 4.1)
    - AR (Story 4.2)
    - STs (Story 4.3, when implemented)
    - Classify phase (Story 4.4, when implemented)
  - [ ] Calculate confidence for each phase:
    - Phase A: should score 85-95 (high confidence)
    - Phase B: should score 80-90 (good confidence)
    - Phase C: depends on Spring quality
  - [ ] Verify confidence scoring aligns with manual analysis
  - [ ] Test ambiguous phase:
    - Find period with unclear phase (e.g., range oscillation without clear SC)
    - Should score 50-60 and get rejected per AC 9
  - [ ] Log all confidence scores for manual verification

- [ ] **Task 17: Write test for confidence threshold enforcement** (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Test Phase A with 75% confidence:
    - Assert: should_reject_phase(75) returns False (passes threshold)
    - Phase should be accepted for trading
  - [ ] Test Phase A with 70% confidence (exact threshold):
    - Assert: should_reject_phase(70) returns False (passes, >= 70)
  - [ ] Test Phase A with 69% confidence:
    - Assert: should_reject_phase(69) returns True (rejected, < 70)
  - [ ] Test Phase A with 50% confidence:
    - Assert: should_reject_phase(50) returns True (rejected)
  - [ ] Verify FR3 enforcement: only phases with 70%+ used for trading

- [ ] **Task 18: Add comprehensive docstrings and examples** (AC: all)
  - [ ] Add function-level docstrings:
    - calculate_phase_confidence: full algorithm, scoring components, FR3 threshold
    - _score_event_presence: event requirements per phase
    - _score_event_quality: quality calculation for each event type
    - _score_sequence_validity: sequence validation rules
    - _score_range_context: range context checks
    - should_reject_phase: rejection logic
  - [ ] Add usage examples:
    ```python
    # Example: Calculate Phase A confidence
    from backend.src.pattern_engine.phase_detector import (
        calculate_phase_confidence,
        should_reject_phase
    )
    from backend.src.models.phase_events import PhaseEvents
    from backend.src.models.wyckoff_phase import WyckoffPhase

    # Detected events (from Stories 4.1, 4.2, etc.)
    events = PhaseEvents(
        sc=detected_sc,  # From Story 4.1
        ar=detected_ar   # From Story 4.2
    )

    # Calculate confidence
    confidence = calculate_phase_confidence(
        phase=WyckoffPhase.A,
        events=events,
        trading_range=trading_range
    )

    print(f"Phase A Confidence: {confidence}%")

    # Check if phase passes FR3 threshold
    if should_reject_phase(confidence):
        print(f"⚠️ Phase rejected (confidence {confidence}% < 70%)")
        print("Not safe for trading per FR3")
    else:
        print(f"✓ Phase accepted (confidence {confidence}% >= 70%)")
        print("Safe for trading per FR3")

    # Scoring breakdown (from logs):
    # Event Presence: 40/40 (SC + AR both present)
    # Event Quality: 28/30 (avg quality 93%)
    # Sequence Validity: 20/20 (perfect timing)
    # Range Context: 10/10 (good alignment)
    # Total: 98/100
    ```
  - [ ] Add inline comments explaining scoring rationale
  - [ ] Document FR3 requirement (70% minimum for trading)

- [ ] **Task 19: Document integration points for Story 4.4 and 4.7** (AC: all)
  - [ ] Story 4.4 (Phase Classification) will use calculate_phase_confidence:
    ```python
    # Story 4.4: classify_phase will call confidence scoring
    phase_classification = classify_phase(events, trading_range)
    confidence = calculate_phase_confidence(
        phase_classification.phase,
        events,
        trading_range
    )

    if should_reject_phase(confidence):
        # Reject phase, don't use for trading
        return None

    # Update phase_classification.confidence
    phase_classification.confidence = confidence
    return phase_classification
    ```
  - [ ] Story 4.7 (PhaseDetector Integration) will use confidence for FR3:
    ```python
    # Story 4.7: PhaseDetector will enforce FR3
    phase_info = phase_detector.detect_phase(range, bars, volume_analysis)

    if phase_info.confidence < 70:
        # Don't generate trade signals from this phase
        logger.warning("low_confidence_phase_rejected",
                      phase=phase_info.phase,
                      confidence=phase_info.confidence)
        return None  # No signals from low-confidence phases
    ```
  - [ ] Ensure PhaseEvents model is complete for Story 4.4/4.7 consumption

- [ ] **Task 20: Create confidence scoring visualization helper** (AC: 8, 9, 10)
  - [ ] Create script: `backend/scripts/visualize_phase_confidence.py`
  - [ ] Load OHLCV data with phase detection
  - [ ] For each detected phase, calculate confidence
  - [ ] Create visualization:
    - Bar chart showing confidence breakdown:
      - Event Presence (0-40 pts)
      - Event Quality (0-30 pts)
      - Sequence Validity (0-20 pts)
      - Range Context (0-10 pts)
    - Horizontal line at 70% threshold
    - Color coding: green if >=70%, yellow if 60-69%, red if <60%
  - [ ] Annotate with:
    - Total confidence score
    - Pass/fail vs. FR3 threshold
    - Which events detected
    - Rejection reasons if <70%
  - [ ] Save chart for manual verification
  - [ ] Use for integration test validation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 4.1 Completion (Selling Climax Detection):**
[Source: Story 4.1]
- `detect_selling_climax()` returns Optional[SellingClimax]
- SellingClimax has **confidence score (0-100)** calculated from:
  - Volume strength: 40 points
  - Spread width: 30 points
  - Close position: 30 points
- SC confidence used in Phase A quality scoring

**Story 4.2 Completion (Automatic Rally Detection):**
[Source: Story 4.2]
- `detect_automatic_rally()` returns Optional[AutomaticRally]
- AR doesn't have explicit confidence score
- **AR quality derived from**:
  - Rally percentage (>5% = high, 3-5% = medium, exactly 3% = low)
  - Timing (≤5 bars = ideal, 6-10 bars = delayed)
  - Volume profile (HIGH vs. NORMAL)
- AR quality used in Phase A quality scoring

**Story 4.3 (Secondary Test Detection):**
[Source: Epic 4.3 AC]
- Will implement `detect_secondary_test()` → Optional[SecondaryTest]
- ST quality derived from:
  - Volume reduction vs. SC (>50% = high, 25-50% = medium, <25% = low)
  - Distance from SC low (within 2% tolerance)
- Multiple STs can be detected (Phase B builds cause)

**Story 4.4 (Phase Classification):**
[Source: Epic 4.4 AC]
- Will implement `classify_phase()` → PhaseClassification
- PhaseClassification dataclass: phase, confidence, duration, events_detected
- **This story (4.5) provides the confidence calculation for Story 4.4**
- Story 4.4 will call calculate_phase_confidence and reject phases <70%

**Key Learnings from Previous Stories:**
- Events have varying confidence/quality metrics
- SC has explicit confidence (Story 4.1)
- AR quality derived from rally % and timing (Story 4.2)
- Phase confidence must aggregate individual event confidences
- FR3 requirement: 70% minimum confidence for trading
- Low-confidence phases must be rejected with detailed logging

### Algorithm Details

**Phase Confidence Scoring Algorithm:**
[Source: Epic 4.5 AC and FR3]

**Purpose:** Calculate confidence score (0-100) for phase classification to enforce FR3 requirement (70% minimum for trading). Confidence based on event presence, event quality, sequence validity, and range context.

**4-Component Scoring System (Total: 100 points):**

#### Component 1: Event Presence (40 points) - AC 2

**Purpose:** Verify all required events for phase are detected.

**Phase A Requirements:**
```python
def _score_event_presence_phase_a(events: PhaseEvents) -> int:
    """
    Phase A requires SC + AR (stopping action complete).

    Scoring:
    - SC present: +20 points
    - AR present: +20 points
    - Total: 40 points if both present
    """
    score = 0

    if events.sc is not None:
        score += 20

    if events.ar is not None:
        score += 20

    return score
```

**Phase B Requirements:**
```python
def _score_event_presence_phase_b(events: PhaseEvents) -> int:
    """
    Phase B requires Phase A + at least 1 ST (building cause).

    Scoring:
    - Phase A confirmed (SC + AR): +20 points
    - 1 ST present: +10 points
    - 2+ STs present: +20 points (stronger cause)
    - Total: 40 points if Phase A + 2+ STs
    """
    score = 0

    # Phase A must be complete
    if events.has_phase_a():
        score += 20

    # Secondary Tests
    st_count = events.get_st_count()
    if st_count >= 2:
        score += 20  # Strong cause building
    elif st_count == 1:
        score += 10  # Minimal cause
    else:
        score += 0   # No STs, can't be Phase B

    return score
```

**Phase C Requirements:**
```python
def _score_event_presence_phase_c(events: PhaseEvents) -> int:
    """
    Phase C requires Phase B + Spring (final test).

    Scoring:
    - Phase B confirmed: +20 points
    - Spring present: +20 points
    - Total: 40 points
    """
    score = 0

    if events.has_phase_b():
        score += 20

    if events.spring is not None:
        score += 20

    return score
```

**Phase D Requirements:**
```python
def _score_event_presence_phase_d(events: PhaseEvents) -> int:
    """
    Phase D requires SOS (breakout above Ice).

    SOS alone defines Phase D.
    LPS optional (adds confirmation but not required).

    Scoring:
    - SOS present: +40 points (SOS is primary signal)
    - Total: 40 points if SOS
    """
    score = 0

    if events.sos is not None:
        score += 40  # SOS alone is sufficient for Phase D

    # Note: LPS adds quality, not presence
    # Covered in event quality scoring

    return score
```

**Event Presence Rationale:**
- Each phase has specific event requirements
- Missing events = incomplete phase = low confidence
- Partial events = low score (e.g., SC without AR = only 20 points)

#### Component 2: Event Quality (30 points) - AC 3

**Purpose:** Assess quality of detected events based on their confidence scores or characteristics.

**Event Quality Calculation:**
```python
def _score_event_quality(phase: WyckoffPhase, events: PhaseEvents) -> int:
    """
    Calculate average quality of events, scaled to 30 points.

    Event quality sources:
    - SC: has explicit confidence (0-100) from Story 4.1
    - AR: derived from rally %, timing, volume profile
    - ST: derived from volume reduction vs. SC
    - Spring: will have confidence from Epic 5
    - SOS: will have confidence from Epic 5

    Formula:
    1. Extract quality (0-100) for each relevant event
    2. Calculate average
    3. Scale to 30 points: (avg_quality / 100) * 30
    """
    qualities = []

    # Calculate average quality
    if not qualities:
        return 0  # No events to score

    avg_quality = sum(qualities) / len(qualities)

    # Scale to 30 points
    quality_score = int((avg_quality / 100.0) * 30)

    return quality_score
```

**AR Quality Derivation:**
```python
def _calculate_ar_quality(ar: AutomaticRally) -> int:

```

**Event Quality Rationale:**
- Higher quality events = higher confidence in phase
- SC has explicit confidence from detection
- AR/ST quality derived from characteristics
- Average quality scaled to 30 points max

#### Component 3: Sequence Validity (20 points) - AC 4

**Purpose:** Verify events occur in correct order and timing.

**Sequence Validation:**
```python

**Sequence Validity Rationale:**
- Events must occur in logical Wyckoff sequence
- Timing validates event relationships
- Proper duration indicates valid phase

#### Component 4: Range Context (10 points) - AC 5

**Range Context Rationale:**
- Phases should align with trading range structure
- Events should respect range levels (Creek, Ice)
- Range quality affects phase confidence

### Wyckoff Context

**Role of Confidence Scoring in Wyckoff Analysis:**
[Source: Wyckoff methodology and FR3]

**Confidence Scoring Purpose:**
> "Phase confidence scoring ensures only high-quality phase identifications (70%+) are used for trading decisions. Low-confidence phases are rejected to prevent false signals and protect capital (FR3)."

**FR3 Requirement:**
- **Minimum 70% confidence** for any trading decision
- Phases scoring <70% are discarded
- Protects against false phase identifications

**Confidence Components Explained:**

1. **Event Presence (40%)**: Foundation
   - Are all required events detected?
   - Missing events = incomplete phase = reject

2. **Event Quality (30%)**: Signal strength
   - How strong are the detected events?
   - Weak events = low confidence phase

3. **Sequence Validity (20%)**: Timing
   - Do events occur in correct order?
   - Is timing appropriate?
   - Invalid sequence = reject

4. **Range Context (10%)**: Alignment
   - Does phase fit the trading range?
   - Do events respect range levels?
   - Poor context = reduce confidence

**Confidence Ranges:**
- **90-100%**: Excellent phase (textbook pattern)
- **80-89%**: Strong phase (high confidence)
- **70-79%**: Good phase (acceptable, meets FR3)
- **60-69%**: Marginal phase (reject, below FR3)
- **<60%**: Weak phase (reject, low confidence)

**Phase Confidence in Trading Workflow:**
```
Detect Events (Stories 4.1-4.3)
    ↓
Classify Phase (Story 4.4)
    ↓
Calculate Confidence (Story 4.5) ← THIS STORY
    ↓
Check >= 70% (FR3)
    ↓
    ├─ Yes (≥70%): Use for trading
    └─ No (<70%): Reject, log reasons
```

### Coding Standards

**Naming Conventions:**
[Source: [architecture/15-coding-standards.md](../../../docs/architecture/15-coding-standards.md#152-naming-conventions)]
- Python Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `PhaseEvents`, `WyckoffPhase`)
- Python Functions: snake_case (e.g., `calculate_phase_confidence`, `_score_event_presence`)
- Python Variables: snake_case (e.g., `event_score`, `quality_score`)
- Private helpers: _leading_underscore (e.g., `_calculate_ar_quality`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MIN_PHASE_CONFIDENCE`)

**Type Safety:**
[Source: [architecture/15-coding-standards.md](../../../docs/architecture/15-coding-standards.md#151-critical-fullstack-rules)]
- ✅ Use type hints: `def calculate_phase_confidence(phase: WyckoffPhase, events: PhaseEvents, trading_range: TradingRange) -> int:`
- ✅ Use Pydantic models for data structures (PhaseEvents)
- ✅ Use Decimal for calculations where precision matters
- ✅ Validate inputs (phase enum, events not None)

### Error Handling & Logging

**Input Validation:**
[Source: Epic 4.5 AC and best practices]
```python
def calculate_phase_confidence(phase, events, trading_range) -> int:
    # Validate inputs
    if not isinstance(phase, WyckoffPhase):
        logger.error("invalid_phase_type",
                    phase_type=type(phase).__name__)
        raise ValueError("phase must be WyckoffPhase enum")

    if events is None:
        logger.error("events_is_none")
        raise ValueError("events cannot be None")

    if trading_range is None:
        logger.warning("trading_range_is_none",
                      message="Range context scoring will be skipped")

    # ... confidence calculation
```

**Logging Strategy:**
[Source: [architecture/17-monitoring-and-observability.md](../../../docs/architecture/17-monitoring-and-observability.md), AC 10]
- Use `structlog` for structured JSON logging
- Log start: phase, events summary
- Log each scoring component: score and breakdown
- Log total confidence: pass/fail vs. 70%
- **Critical: Log low-confidence rejections with detailed reasons**

**Logging Example:**
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)

### Performance Requirements

**Performance Targets:**
[Source: Epic 4 overall performance]
- **Single confidence calculation:** <5ms (simple arithmetic)
- **Batch processing:** <50ms for 10 phases
- O(n) where n = number of events (typically <10)
- No complex algorithms, mostly arithmetic

**Performance Considerations:**
- Confidence scoring is pure calculation
- No I/O, no database queries
- Event quality derivation is O(1) per event
- Suitable for real-time phase detection

### Integration Notes

**Story 4.4 Dependencies (Phase Classification):**
[Source: Epic 4.4 AC]

Story 4.4 will use calculate_phase_confidence:

```python
# Story 4.4: classify_phase will integrate confidence scoring
def classify_phase(events, trading_range) -> Optional[PhaseClassification]:
    # Determine phase based on events
    phase = _determine_phase(events)  # Story 4.4 logic

    # Calculate confidence (THIS STORY)
    confidence = calculate_phase_confidence(phase, events, trading_range)

    # Reject if below FR3 threshold
    if should_reject_phase(confidence):
        logger.warning("phase_rejected_low_confidence",
                      phase=phase.value,
                      confidence=confidence)
        return None

    # Create PhaseClassification with confidence
    return PhaseClassification(
        phase=phase,
        confidence=confidence,
        events_detected=events,
        duration=_calculate_duration(events, trading_range)
    )
```

**Story 4.7 Dependencies (PhaseDetector Integration):**
[Source: Epic 4.7 AC]

Story 4.7 will use confidence for FR3 enforcement:

```python
# Story 4.7: PhaseDetector enforces FR3
class PhaseDetector:
    def detect_phase(self, range, bars, volume_analysis) -> Optional[PhaseInfo]:
        # Detect all events
        events = self._detect_all_events(bars, volume_analysis)

        # Classify phase
        phase_classification = classify_phase(events, range)

        if phase_classification is None:
            # Phase rejected due to low confidence
            return None

        # Phase confidence already checked in classify_phase
        # confidence guaranteed >= 70% if we reach here

        return PhaseInfo(
            phase=phase_classification.phase,
            confidence=phase_classification.confidence,
            events=events,
            # ...
        )
```
