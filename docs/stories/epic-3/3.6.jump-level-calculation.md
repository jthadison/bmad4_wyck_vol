# Story 3.6: Jump Level Calculation (Price Target)

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** level calculator,
**I want** to calculate the Jump level (price target) using Wyckoff Point & Figure cause-effect method,
**so that** traders have realistic profit targets based on accumulation duration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Function: `calculate_jump_level(range: TradingRange) -> JumpLevel`
2. Cause factor determination by duration (FR10 specification):
   - 40+ bars: cause_factor = 3.0x
   - 25-39 bars: cause_factor = 2.5x
   - 15-24 bars: cause_factor = 2.0x
   - <15 bars: reject range (insufficient cause)
3. Formula: jump = ice + (cause_factor × range_width)
4. Range width: range_width = ice - creek
5. JumpLevel dataclass: price, cause_factor, range_duration, confidence
6. Conservative alternative: jump = ice + range_width (1x projection, lower risk)
7. Confidence scoring: longer duration = higher confidence
8. Unit test: 40-bar range with $10 width calculates jump correctly (ice + $30)
9. Integration test: Jump levels for known AAPL ranges produce realistic targets
10. Validation: jump > ice (target above resistance)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create JumpLevel data model** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create file: `backend/src/models/jump_level.py`
  - [x] Define Pydantic model: `class JumpLevel(BaseModel):`

    - `price: Decimal` - jump target price (aggressive projection)
    - `conservative_price: Decimal` - conservative target (1x projection)
    - `range_width: Decimal` - ice - creek (accumulation range size)
    - `cause_factor: Decimal` - 2.0x, 2.5x, or 3.0x based on duration
    - `range_duration: int` - number of bars in accumulation
    - `confidence: str` - HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW based on duration

    - price > ice_price (jump above ice)
    - conservative_price > ice_price (conservative jump above ice)
  - [x] Configure JSON serialization

- [x] **Task 2: Update level_calculator module** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Open file: `backend/src/pattern_engine/level_calculator.py`
  - [x] Import dependencies: TradingRange, CreekLevel, IceLevel, JumpLevel, Decimal
  - [x] Add module docstring section for Jump level calculation
  - [x] Import structlog for logging
  - [x] Define constants:
    - `CAUSE_FACTOR_LONG = Decimal("3.0")` (40+ bars, strong cause)
    - `CAUSE_FACTOR_MEDIUM = Decimal("2.5")` (25-39 bars, good cause)
    - `CAUSE_FACTOR_SHORT = Decimal("2.0")` (15-24 bars, adequate cause)
    - `CONSERVATIVE_FACTOR = Decimal("1.0")` (conservative projection)
    - `MIN_RANGE_DURATION = 15` (minimum per AC 2)

- [x] **Task 3: Implement `calculate_jump_level` function signature** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create function: `def calculate_jump_level(trading_range: TradingRange, creek: CreekLevel, ice: IceLevel) -> JumpLevel:`
  - [x] Add comprehensive docstring:
    - Purpose: calculate Jump level (price target) using Wyckoff cause-effect
    - Parameters: trading_range (for duration), creek (support reference), ice (resistance reference)
    - Returns: JumpLevel with aggressive and conservative targets
    - Algorithm: Wyckoff Point & Figure method - longer accumulation = greater effect
    - Wyckoff context: "The effect (price move) is proportional to the cause (accumulation duration)"
  - [x] Validate inputs:
    - trading_range is not None
    - creek is not None
    - ice is not None
    - ice.price > creek.price (verified by Story 3.8, defensive check)
    - trading_range.duration >= MIN_RANGE_DURATION (15 bars)
  - [x] Return JumpLevel object

- [x] **Task 4: Extract range duration and calculate range width** (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Get range duration: range_duration = trading_range.duration
  - [x] **Validate minimum duration (AC 2):**
    - If range_duration < 15 bars:
      - Log error: "Insufficient cause, range duration {duration} < 15 bars minimum"
      - Raise ValueError("Range duration too short for Jump calculation")
      - Wyckoff: short accumulation = weak cause = unreliable projection
  - [x] Calculate range width: range_width = ice.price - creek.price
  - [x] **Defensive validation:**
    - Assert range_width > 0 (ice should be above creek)
    - If not, log error and raise ValueError

- [x] **Task 5: Determine cause factor based on duration** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement cause factor determination logic:
    ```python
    if range_duration >= 40:
        cause_factor = CAUSE_FACTOR_LONG  # 3.0x
        confidence = "HIGH"
    elif range_duration >= 25:
        cause_factor = CAUSE_FACTOR_MEDIUM  # 2.5x
        confidence = "MEDIUM"
    elif range_duration >= 15:
        cause_factor = CAUSE_FACTOR_SHORT  # 2.0x
        confidence = "LOW"
    else:
        # Should never reach here due to Task 4 validation
        raise ValueError(f"Insufficient range duration: {range_duration} bars")
    ```
  - [x] Log cause factor determination:
    - "range_duration={duration} → cause_factor={factor}, confidence={confidence}"
  - [x] Wyckoff rationale:
    - **40+ bars:** Extended accumulation, strong smart money position, high confidence in large move
    - **25-39 bars:** Good accumulation, moderate confidence
    - **15-24 bars:** Adequate accumulation, lower confidence, smaller expected move

- [x] **Task 6: Calculate aggressive jump target** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Apply Wyckoff Point & Figure formula:
    ```python
    # Formula: jump = ice + (cause_factor × range_width)
    effect = cause_factor * range_width
    jump_price = ice.price + effect
    ```
  - [x] Example calculation:
    ```python
    # Example: 40-bar range
    # Creek: $100, Ice: $110, Range Width: $10
    # Cause Factor: 3.0x (40+ bars)
    # Effect: 3.0 × $10 = $30
    # Jump: $110 + $30 = $140
    ```
  - [x] Wyckoff interpretation:
    - Range width represents accumulation zone size
    - Cause factor amplifies based on accumulation duration
    - Jump is upside projection after SOS breakout

- [x] **Task 7: Calculate conservative jump target** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Apply conservative 1x projection:
    ```python
    # Conservative formula: conservative_jump = ice + (1.0 × range_width)
    conservative_effect = CONSERVATIVE_FACTOR * range_width
    conservative_price = ice.price + conservative_effect
    ```
  - [x] Example calculation:
    ```python
    # Same example as Task 6
    # Conservative: $110 + (1.0 × $10) = $120
    # More realistic, lower risk target
    ```
  - [x] Purpose:
    - Conservative traders use 1x projection (measured move)
    - Lower risk/reward but higher probability
    - Suitable for partial profit-taking

- [x] **Task 8: Calculate risk-reward ratios** (AC: all)
  - [x] Calculate aggressive risk-reward:
    ```python
    # Risk: ice - creek (range width, stop at creek)
    # Reward: jump - ice (upside from breakout)
    # RR = reward / risk
    aggressive_reward = jump_price - ice.price
    risk = ice.price - creek.price  # Same as range_width
    risk_reward_ratio = aggressive_reward / risk
    # Simplifies to: risk_reward_ratio = cause_factor
    ```
  - [x] Calculate conservative risk-reward:
    ```python
    conservative_reward = conservative_price - ice.price
    conservative_risk_reward = conservative_reward / risk
    # Always equals 1.0 for conservative projection
    ```
  - [x] Example:
    ```python
    # Aggressive: ($140 - $110) / ($110 - $100) = $30 / $10 = 3.0
    # Conservative: ($120 - $110) / ($110 - $100) = $10 / $10 = 1.0
    ```
  - [x] Trading interpretation:
    - Aggressive: 3:1 RR for 40+ bar range (risk $10 to make $30)
    - Conservative: 1:1 RR (risk $10 to make $10, safer)

- [x] **Task 9: Validate jump > ice** (AC: 10)
  - [x] Validate aggressive jump:
    - Assert jump_price > ice.price
    - If not, log error: "Invalid jump calculation, jump must be above ice"
  - [x] Validate conservative jump:
    - Assert conservative_price > ice.price
    - If not, log error: "Invalid conservative jump"
  - [x] Both should always pass if math is correct, defensive validation

- [x] **Task 10: Create JumpLevel object and return** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create JumpLevel instance with all calculated fields:
    ```python
    jump_level = JumpLevel(
        price=jump_price,
        conservative_price=conservative_price,
        range_width=range_width,
        cause_factor=cause_factor,
        range_duration=range_duration,
        confidence=confidence,
        risk_reward_ratio=risk_reward_ratio,
        conservative_risk_reward=conservative_risk_reward,
        ice_price=ice.price,
        creek_price=creek.price,
        calculated_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    )
    ```
  - [x] Return JumpLevel object

[Source: Story 3.3]
- Quality score ensures only valid ranges used for Jump calculation
- Duration component (30 points): 15 bars = 15 pts, 40+ bars = 30 pts
- **Connection to Jump:** Duration tiers in quality scoring align with cause factors

**Story 3.4 Completion (Creek Level):**
[Source: Story 3.4]
- `calculate_creek_level()` returns CreekLevel with volume-weighted support price
- Creek.price is lower bound for range width calculation
- **Jump dependency:** jump = ice + (cause_factor × (ice - creek))

**Story 3.5 Completion (Ice Level):**
[Source: Story 3.5]
- `calculate_ice_level()` returns IceLevel with volume-weighted resistance price
- Ice.price is breakout level and base for Jump projection
- **Jump dependency:** Jump projects upward from Ice level

**Key Learnings from Stories 3.4-3.5:**
- Both Creek and Ice required for Jump calculation
- Range width (ice - creek) represents accumulation zone size
- Jump amplifies range width by cause factor
- **Story 3.6 (this story) completes the three-level system:**
  - Creek: support (entry/stop reference)
  - Ice: resistance (breakout level)
  - Jump: target (profit objective)

**Integration with Story 3.6:**
- Story 3.6 (this story) calculates Jump level from Creek + Ice
- Uses TradingRange.duration to determine cause factor
- Provides both aggressive (2-3x) and conservative (1x) targets
- **Story 3.8 will integrate all three levels into TradingRangeDetector**

### Algorithm Details

**Jump Level Calculation Algorithm:**
[Source: Epic 3.6 AC and Wyckoff Point & Figure methodology]

**Purpose:** Calculate Jump level (price target) using Wyckoff cause-effect principle. The "cause" (accumulation duration) determines the "effect" (price move). Longer accumulation predicts larger upside potential.

**Wyckoff Cause-Effect Principle:**
> "The effect (price move) must be proportional to the cause (accumulation). A large cause (extended accumulation) produces a large effect (significant price advance). A small cause produces a small effect."

**Step-by-Step Algorithm:**

#### Step 1: Validate Inputs and Extract Duration (AC 1, 2)
```python
def calculate_jump_level(trading_range, creek, ice):
    # Extract range duration
    range_duration = trading_range.duration  # bars

    # Validate minimum duration (AC 2)
    if range_duration < MIN_RANGE_DURATION:  # 15 bars
        logger.error("insufficient_cause",
                    duration=range_duration,
                    minimum=MIN_RANGE_DURATION)
        raise ValueError(f"Range duration {range_duration} < 15 bars, insufficient cause")

    # Defensive validation: ice > creek
    if ice.price <= creek.price:
        logger.error("invalid_range", ice=ice.price, creek=creek.price)
        raise ValueError("Ice must be above Creek")
```

**Why 15 bars minimum?**
- FR10 specification: ranges <15 bars lack sufficient cause
- Short accumulation = weak foundation for projection
- Aligns with Story 3.3 quality scoring (15 bars = minimum threshold)

#### Step 2: Calculate Range Width (AC 4)
```python
# Range width = accumulation zone size
range_width = ice.price - creek.price

# Example:
# Creek: $100, Ice: $110 → Range Width: $10
```

**Why range width matters:**
- Represents size of accumulation zone
- Larger range = more accumulation = greater potential move
- Base unit for projection (amplified by cause factor)

#### Step 3: Determine Cause Factor Based on Duration (AC 2)
```python
# Wyckoff cause factor determination
if range_duration >= 40:
    cause_factor = Decimal("3.0")
    confidence = "HIGH"
    # Strong cause: extended accumulation (6-8 weeks on daily charts)
elif range_duration >= 25:
    cause_factor = Decimal("2.5")
    confidence = "MEDIUM"
    # Good cause: moderate accumulation (5-7 weeks)
elif range_duration >= 15:
    cause_factor = Decimal("2.0")
    confidence = "LOW"
    # Adequate cause: short accumulation (3-5 weeks)
else:
    # Rejected in Step 1
    raise ValueError("Insufficient cause")
```

**Cause Factor Rationale:**

| Duration | Cause Factor | Confidence | Wyckoff Interpretation |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| 40+ bars | 3.0x | HIGH | Extended accumulation, large professional position, high probability of significant move |
| 25-39 bars | 2.5x | MEDIUM | Good accumulation, moderate position, reasonable upside expectation |
| 15-24 bars | 2.0x | LOW | Adequate accumulation, smaller position, conservative projection |
| <15 bars | Rejected | N/A | Insufficient cause, unreliable projection |

**FR10 Specification:**
> "Cause factor determination: 40+ bars = 3.0x, 25-39 bars = 2.5x, 15-24 bars = 2.0x, <15 bars = reject"

#### Step 4: Calculate Aggressive Jump Target (AC 3)
```python
# Wyckoff Point & Figure formula
# jump = ice + (cause_factor × range_width)
effect = cause_factor * range_width
jump_price = ice.price + effect

# Example: 40-bar range
# Creek: $100, Ice: $110, Width: $10, Factor: 3.0x
# Effect: 3.0 × $10 = $30
# Jump: $110 + $30 = $140
```

**Why this formula?**
- Ice is breakout point (resistance becomes support after SOS)
- Effect is upside move predicted by accumulation
- Jump is final target after successful breakout

**Wyckoff Context:**
- Traditional P&F: count columns and multiply by box size
- BMAD simplification: use duration as proxy for cause
- More algorithmic, less subjective than manual P&F charting

#### Step 5: Calculate Conservative Jump Target (AC 6)
```python
# Conservative 1x projection (measured move)
conservative_effect = Decimal("1.0") * range_width
conservative_price = ice.price + conservative_effect

# Example:
# Conservative: $110 + (1.0 × $10) = $120
```

**Why conservative target?**
- **Risk management:** Not all accumulations produce 2-3x moves
- **Partial profits:** Take 50% profits at conservative, let 50% run to aggressive
- **Lower confidence ranges:** For 15-24 bar ranges, conservative may be primary target

**Trading Strategy:**
```python
# Two-target approach
if jump.confidence == "HIGH":
    primary_target = jump.price  # Aim for aggressive (3x)
    partial_profit = jump.conservative_price  # Take 50% at conservative
else:  # MEDIUM or LOW
    primary_target = jump.conservative_price  # Aim for conservative (1x)
    # Let 25% run to aggressive if momentum persists
```

#### Step 6: Calculate Risk-Reward Ratios (AC all)
```python
# Aggressive risk-reward
aggressive_reward = jump_price - ice.price  # Effect
risk = ice.price - creek.price  # Range width
risk_reward_ratio = aggressive_reward / risk
# Simplifies to: RR = cause_factor (2.0, 2.5, or 3.0)

# Conservative risk-reward
conservative_reward = conservative_price - ice.price  # Conservative effect
conservative_risk_reward = conservative_reward / risk
# Always equals 1.0

# Example:
# Aggressive: ($140 - $110) / ($110 - $100) = $30 / $10 = 3.0
# Conservative: ($120 - $110) / ($110 - $100) = $10 / $10 = 1.0
```

**Risk-Reward Interpretation:**

| Cause Factor | Aggressive RR | Conservative RR | Trading Decision |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 3.0x (HIGH) | 3:1 | 1:1 | Risk $10 to make $30 (aggressive) or $10 (conservative) |
| 2.5x (MEDIUM) | 2.5:1 | 1:1 | Risk $10 to make $25 (aggressive) or $10 (conservative) |
| 2.0x (LOW) | 2:1 | 1:1 | Risk $10 to make $20 (aggressive) or $10 (conservative) |

**Trade Planning:**
- **Stop loss:** 2% below Creek ($98 if Creek is $100)
- **Entry:** Breakout above Ice ($110)
- **Risk per share:** Ice - Creek = $10
- **Reward (aggressive):** Jump - Ice = $30 (3.0x range)
- **Reward (conservative):** Conservative - Ice = $10 (1.0x range)

#### Step 7: Validate Jump > Ice (AC 10)
```python
# Defensive validation (should always pass with correct math)
assert jump_price > ice.price, "Jump must be above Ice"
assert conservative_price > ice.price, "Conservative jump must be above Ice"

# Both validations should always pass because:
# - cause_factor >= 2.0 (minimum)
# - range_width > 0 (validated earlier)
# - Therefore: ice + (2.0 × width) > ice + (0 × width) = ice
```

### Wyckoff Context

**Role of Jump Level in Wyckoff Analysis:**
[Source: Wyckoff Point & Figure methodology and BMAD framework]

**Jump Definition:**
> "Jump is the upside price target calculated using Wyckoff's cause-effect principle. The effect (price move) is proportional to the cause (accumulation duration). Jump represents the expected profit objective after a Sign of Strength (SOS) breakout."

**Wyckoff Point & Figure Method:**

Traditional Wyckoff Point & Figure charting:
1. **Horizontal Count:** Count columns in accumulation (cause)
2. **Multiply by Box Size:** columns × box_size = vertical projection (effect)
3. **Add to Breakout Level:** ice + effect = jump target

**BMAD Adaptation:**
- **Cause proxy:** Use duration (bars) instead of column count
- **Simplified tiers:** 3 duration tiers instead of continuous column counting
- **Cause factors:** 2.0x, 2.5x, 3.0x based on duration thresholds
- **Why?** Easier to implement algorithmically, less subjective, data-driven

**Accumulation Duration and Effect:**

**40+ Bars (HIGH confidence, 3.0x):**
- **Wyckoff interpretation:** Extended accumulation, large professional position
- **Smart money activity:** Multiple tests of Creek and Ice on decreasing volume
- **Absorption:** Supply exhausted through long accumulation
- **Expected effect:** Large upside move (3x range width) after SOS breakout
- **Example:** 40-bar range with $10 width → $30 upside target

**25-39 Bars (MEDIUM confidence, 2.5x):**
- **Wyckoff interpretation:** Good accumulation, moderate professional position
- **Smart money activity:** Several tests of support/resistance
- **Absorption:** Supply mostly absorbed
- **Expected effect:** Good upside move (2.5x range width)
- **Example:** 30-bar range with $10 width → $25 upside target

**15-24 Bars (LOW confidence, 2.0x):**
- **Wyckoff interpretation:** Adequate accumulation, smaller position
- **Smart money activity:** Minimal tests of support/resistance
- **Absorption:** Some supply absorbed, but less certain
- **Expected effect:** Moderate upside move (2x range width)
- **Example:** 20-bar range with $10 width → $20 upside target
- **Recommendation:** Use conservative target (1x) as primary

**<15 Bars (Rejected):**
- **Wyckoff interpretation:** Insufficient cause, weak foundation
- **Risk:** Projection unreliable, breakout likely to fail
- **Action:** Reject range, do not calculate Jump

**Jump Usage in Trade Planning:**

**Entry Setup (after SOS breakout):**
```python
# SOS breakout detected (Epic 5)
if bar.close > ice.price and bar.volume_ratio >= 1.5:
    entry_price = ice.price  # Enter on breakout
    stop_loss = creek.price * 0.98  # 2% below creek

    # Target selection based on confidence
    if jump.confidence == "HIGH":
        target_1 = jump.conservative_price  # Take 50% profits
        target_2 = jump.price  # Let 50% run
    else:
        target_1 = jump.conservative_price  # Primary target
        target_2 = jump.price  # Aspirational (25% position)
```

**Position Sizing:**
```python
# Risk-based position sizing
risk_per_share = entry_price - stop_loss  # e.g., $110 - $98 = $12
account_risk = account_size * 0.02  # 2% of account
position_size = account_risk / risk_per_share

# Example:
# Account: $100,000
# Account risk: $2,000 (2%)
# Risk/share: $12
# Position: $2,000 / $12 = 166 shares

# Potential profit (aggressive):
# 166 shares × ($140 - $110) = 166 × $30 = $4,980
# Risk/Reward: $4,980 / $2,000 = 2.49:1 (accounting for stop below creek)
```

**Profit-Taking Strategy:**
```python
# Two-target approach for HIGH confidence ranges
if jump.confidence == "HIGH":
    # Target 1 (Conservative): Take 50% profits
    if bar.high >= jump.conservative_price:
        sell_pct = 0.5
        remaining_position = position_size * 0.5
        # Move stop to breakeven (ice.price)
        stop_loss = ice.price

    # Target 2 (Aggressive): Let remainder run
    if bar.high >= jump.price:
        sell_pct = 1.0  # Exit full position
```

**Example Jump Analysis:**

**AAPL Accumulation Oct-Nov 2023:**
```
Jump Level Calculation:
--------------------------------------------------
Input Levels:
  Creek (Support): $172.58 (from Story 3.4)
  Ice (Resistance): $178.45 (from Story 3.5)
  Range Width: $178.45 - $172.58 = $5.87
  Range Duration: 37 bars

Cause Factor Determination:
  Duration: 37 bars
  Tier: 25-39 bars → MEDIUM tier
  Cause Factor: 2.5x
  Confidence: MEDIUM

Aggressive Jump Calculation:
  Effect: 2.5 × $5.87 = $14.68
  Jump: $178.45 + $14.68 = $193.13
  Risk-Reward: $14.68 / $5.87 = 2.5:1

Conservative Jump Calculation:
  Conservative Effect: 1.0 × $5.87 = $5.87
  Conservative Jump: $178.45 + $5.87 = $184.32
  Conservative RR: $5.87 / $5.87 = 1:1

Jump Level Summary:
  Aggressive Target: $193.13 (2.5x projection)
  Conservative Target: $184.32 (1x projection)
  Cause Factor: 2.5x (MEDIUM confidence)
  Range Duration: 37 bars (good accumulation)
  Risk-Reward (Aggressive): 2.5:1
  Risk-Reward (Conservative): 1:1

Trade Plan:
  Entry: $178.45 (SOS breakout above Ice)
  Stop: $169.13 (2% below Creek $172.58)
  Target 1: $184.32 (conservative, take 50%)
  Target 2: $193.13 (aggressive, let 50% run)
  Risk/Share: $178.45 - $169.13 = $9.32
  Potential Reward: $193.13 - $178.45 = $14.68
  Actual RR: $14.68 / $9.32 = 1.57:1 (accounting for 2% stop buffer)

Position Sizing (example):
  Account: $100,000
  Risk: 2% = $2,000
  Shares: $2,000 / $9.32 = 215 shares
  Potential Profit (Target 2): 215 × $14.68 = $3,156

Trading Psychology:
  - MEDIUM confidence: use two-target approach
  - Take 50% profits at conservative $184.32 (lock in gains)
  - Let 50% run to aggressive $193.13 (capture full effect)
  - Move stop to breakeven after Target 1 hit
```

### Error Handling & Logging

**Input Validation:**
[Source: Epic 3.6 AC and best practices]
```python
def calculate_jump_level(trading_range, creek, ice) -> JumpLevel:
    # Validate minimum duration (AC 2)
    if trading_range.duration < MIN_RANGE_DURATION:
        logger.error("insufficient_cause",
                    range_id=str(trading_range.id),
                    duration=trading_range.duration,
                    minimum=MIN_RANGE_DURATION,
                    message="Range duration too short for Jump calculation")
        raise ValueError(f"Insufficient cause: {trading_range.duration} bars < 15 minimum")

    # Defensive validation: ice > creek
    if ice.price <= creek.price:
        logger.error("invalid_range",
                    ice_price=float(ice.price),
                    creek_price=float(creek.price),
                    message="Ice must be above Creek")
        raise ValueError("Invalid range: Ice <= Creek")

    # ... jump calculation
```

**Logging Strategy:**
[Source: [architecture/17-monitoring-and-observability.md](../../../docs/architecture/17-monitoring-and-observability.md)]
- Use `structlog` for structured JSON logging
- Log start: symbol, range_id, duration
- Log cause factor: duration, factor, confidence
- Log calculations: range_width, aggressive jump, conservative jump
- Log risk-reward: aggressive RR, conservative RR
- Log final jump: aggressive target, conservative target, confidence

**Logging Example:**
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)

def calculate_jump_level(trading_range, creek, ice):
    symbol = trading_range.symbol
    logger.info("jump_calculation_start",
               symbol=symbol,
               range_id=str(trading_range.id),
               range_duration=trading_range.duration,
               creek_price=float(creek.price),
               ice_price=float(ice.price))

    # Determine cause factor
    logger.info("cause_factor_determined",
               duration=range_duration,
               cause_factor=float(cause_factor),
               confidence=confidence)

    # Calculate jumps
    logger.info("jump_calculation_complete",
               symbol=symbol,
               range_width=float(range_width),
               aggressive_jump=float(jump_price),
               conservative_jump=float(conservative_price),
               aggressive_rr=float(risk_reward_ratio),
               conservative_rr=float(conservative_risk_reward),
               cause_factor=float(cause_factor),
               confidence=confidence)

    return jump_level
```

### Performance Requirements

        # Stories 3.1-3.3: Detect pivots, cluster, score quality
        trading_range = self._form_trading_range(...)

        # Calculate all three levels
        creek = calculate_creek_level(trading_range, bars, volume_analysis)
        ice = calculate_ice_level(trading_range, bars, volume_analysis)
        jump = calculate_jump_level(trading_range, creek, ice)

        # Populate TradingRange
        trading_range.creek = creek
        trading_range.ice = ice
        trading_range.jump = jump
        trading_range.midpoint = (creek.price + ice.price) / 2

        return trading_range
```

- Conservative target calculation: 1.0x projection for risk management
- All 16 unit tests passing (100% coverage of cause factors, edge cases, validation)
- All 3 integration tests passing (AAPL-based scenarios, realistic targets)
- Risk-reward ratios correctly calculated and match cause factors
- Comprehensive logging and error handling implemented
