**Note:** The AC mentions "mobile/" but the architecture doc does not include it in the current structure. This story will create the structure as defined in the architecture document. If mobile is needed, it should be added in a future story or the AC should be updated.

**Note:** AC mentions "backend subfolders: detectors/, analyzers/, orchestrator/, risk/" - these map to the architecture's `pattern_engine/detectors/` subdirectory structure.

### Tech Stack Requirements

**Source:** [architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**Backend Technologies (Required Versions):**
- Python: 3.11+ (not just 3.10+ as AC states - architecture specifies 3.11+)
- Dependency Manager: Poetry 1.7+ (preferred over pip-tools)
- FastAPI: 0.109+
- SQLAlchemy: 2.0+
- Pydantic: 2.5+
- pandas: 2.2+
- numpy: 1.26+
- httpx: 0.26+ (for API clients)
- websockets: 12.0+ (for real-time data)
- Development tools: pytest 8.0+, mypy 1.8+, Ruff 0.1+ (linting/formatting), pre-commit 3.6+

**Frontend Technologies (Required Versions):**
- TypeScript: 5.3+
- Vue 3: 3.4+ (NOT React - AC incorrectly states React)
- PrimeVue: 3.50+ (UI component library)
- Lightweight Charts: 4.1+ (TradingView charting)
- Pinia: 2.1+ (state management)
- Vite: 5.0+ (build tool)
- Tailwind CSS: 3.4+
- Development tools: Vitest 1.2+, ESLint, Prettier

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker: 24+
- Docker Compose: 2.24+
- PostgreSQL: 15+ (not just any version)
- Database will use TimescaleDB 2.13+ extension (optional for MVP, add when dataset exceeds 1M rows)
- Redis: Optional for caching (can be included in docker-compose)

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** The AC mentions "React frontend" but the tech stack mandates Vue 3. The story implementation must use Vue 3, not React. This is a discrepancy between AC and architecture that needs noting.

### Development Workflow

**Source:** [architecture/11-development-workflow.md]

The initial setup workflow is defined in the architecture document. Key points:
- Use Poetry for Python dependency management with lock files
- Use npm (10+) for frontend with workspaces support
- Docker Compose for local multi-container development
- Pre-commit hooks must run automatically on commit

### Coding Standards

**Source:** [architecture/15-coding-standards.md]

**Naming Conventions:**
- Python classes: PascalCase (e.g., `SpringDetector`)
- Python functions: snake_case (e.g., `calculate_position_size()`)
- Vue components: PascalCase (e.g., `SignalDashboard.vue`)
- Vue composables: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useWebSocket.ts`)
- API routes: kebab-case (e.g., `/api/v1/signals`)
- Database tables: snake_case (e.g., `ohlcv_bars`)
- Environment variables: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `POLYGON_API_KEY`)

**Critical Rules:**
- Types must be defined in `backend/src/models/` using Pydantic
- TypeScript types are auto-generated (DO NOT manually create)
- Use Ruff for Python linting/formatting (NOT Black - Ruff is 10-100x faster)
- Use ESLint + Prettier for TypeScript/Vue
- All financial calculations must use `Decimal` (Python) and `Big` (TypeScript), never `float` or `number`

### Pre-commit Hook Configuration

**Source:** [architecture/3-tech-stack.md, architecture/15-coding-standards.md]

Pre-commit hooks (AC 7) must include:
1. **Ruff** (Python linting and formatting) - replaces Black and isort
2. **mypy** (Python type checking) - strict mode for critical modules
3. **ESLint** (TypeScript linting) - Vue-specific rules
4. **Prettier** (TypeScript/Vue formatting)

**Note:** AC mentions "Black" but the tech stack specifies "Ruff 0.1+" which replaces Black+isort+flake8 with 10-100x faster performance. Use Ruff instead of Black.

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

**Source:** [architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

GitHub Actions workflows to create:
1. **ci.yaml** - Run tests, linting, type checks
2. **codegen.yaml** - Run pydantic-to-typescript on push (skeleton only for this story)
3. **deploy.yaml** - Deploy to VPS (Phase 2, not needed for this story)

The ci.yaml must include:
- Lint stage: Ruff (Python), ESLint (TypeScript)
- Type check stage: mypy (Python)
- Test stage: pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend)

### Docker Compose Configuration

**Source:** [architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md, architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

Services to include in `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml`:
1. **PostgreSQL 15+** - with volume mount for persistence
2. **Python backend** - FastAPI app on port 8000
3. **Vue frontend** - Vite dev server on port 5173 (default Vite port)
4. **Redis** (optional) - for caching, can be included but not strictly required for MVP

Environment variables needed (create `.env.example`):
- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_DB`
- `POLYGON_API_KEY` (not needed for Story 1.1 but document in example)
- `DATABASE_URL`

### Testing Configuration

**Source:** [architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

**Backend Testing:**
- Framework: pytest 8.0+
- Test structure: `backend/tests/unit/`, `backend/tests/integration/`, `backend/tests/fixtures/`
- Must support async tests for FastAPI
- Fixtures for OHLCV test data

**Frontend Testing:**
- Framework: Vitest 1.2+ (Vite-native, fast, Vue Testing Library integration)
- Test structure: `frontend/tests/components/`
- Component unit tests for Vue

**E2E Testing:**
- Playwright 1.41+ (not needed for this story, but note for future)

### Environment File Structure

**.env.example must include:**
```
# Database
POSTGRES_USER=wyckoff_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
POSTGRES_DB=wyckoff_db
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://wyckoff_user:changeme@localhost:5432/wyckoff_db

# Market Data
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Application
BACKEND_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_PORT=5173
```

### README Requirements

Must include:
1. Project title and overview (Wyckoff pattern detection system)
2. Architecture overview with link to `docs/architecture/`
3. Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, Poetry 1.7+, Docker 24+
4. Setup instructions: clone, Poetry install, npm install, environment variables
5. Running locally: docker-compose up, backend server, frontend dev server
6. Testing: pytest command, Vitest command
7. Link to PRD (`docs/prd/`) and architecture docs

### Project Structure Notes

**Discrepancy:** AC 1 mentions creating a "mobile/" directory, but the unified project structure from architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md does not include a mobile directory. This story will follow the architecture document. If mobile support is required, it should be added in a future epic/story or the AC should be updated.

**Discrepancy:** AC 3 states "Backend includes: detectors/, analyzers/, orchestrator/, risk/ subfolders" but the architecture shows these belong under `backend/src/pattern_engine/` (specifically `pattern_engine/detectors/`). The architecture structure will be followed, which properly organizes pattern detection modules under the pattern_engine directory.

**Discrepancy:** AC 4 states "Frontend includes: dashboard/, charts/, config/ subfolders" but the architecture specifies component-based organization: `components/charts/`, `components/signals/`, `components/campaigns/`. The architecture structure will be followed for better Vue component organization.

**CRITICAL Discrepancy:** AC mentions "React frontend" but the tech stack mandates Vue 3.4+. This story will implement Vue 3 as per the authoritative tech stack specification.

### Testing

**Source:** [architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Backend unit tests: `backend/tests/unit/`
- Backend integration tests: `backend/tests/integration/`
- Frontend component tests: `frontend/tests/components/`
- Shared test fixtures: `backend/tests/fixtures/` and `shared/fixtures/`

**Testing Standards:**
- Backend: Use pytest 8.0+ with async support
- Frontend: Use Vitest 1.2+ (Vite-native)
- Test framework must be configured and runnable, even if no actual tests are written in this story
- Create sample "smoke test" to verify pytest and Vitest are properly configured

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- pytest must be installable and runnable via `poetry run pytest`
- Vitest must be installable and runnable via `npm run test`
- Create minimal test files to verify framework setup:
  - `backend/tests/unit/test_example.py` with a simple passing test
  - `frontend/tests/components/example.test.ts` with a simple passing test

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- pytest with fixture system for mock data
- Vitest with Vue Testing Library integration
- Factory pattern for test data generation (factory-boy for Python - will be used in later stories)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** Excellent implementation quality for a foundational repository setup story. The PR delivers a production-ready development environment with comprehensive tooling, clear documentation, and proper adherence to architectural standards. All 10 acceptance criteria are met with thoughtful deviations that align with the authoritative tech stack documentation.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive 254-line README with step-by-step setup instructions
- Production-quality Docker Compose configuration with healthchecks and proper service orchestration
- Full CI/CD pipeline implemented (not just a skeleton) with lint, typecheck, and test stages
- Pre-commit hooks properly configured with Ruff (not Black), mypy, ESLint, and Prettier
- Type hints used consistently in Python code
- Appropriate use of environment variables with .env.example template
- Security-conscious implementation (no secrets, proper CORS, .gitignore comprehensive)

**Technical Decisions:**
- **numpy 2.0+** used instead of 1.26+ to avoid Windows build issues - well-documented and acceptable
- **Vue 3** correctly used (not React from AC) per authoritative tech stack
- **Ruff** correctly used (not Black from AC) per tech stack - 10-100x faster
- **Python 3.13.3** and **Poetry 2.1.3** exceed minimum requirements
- **package-mode=false** in Poetry - correct for application (not library)
